<p>The capricious flame spattered darts of thin yellow light on walls
and floor as the doors swung gently closed. Claudia turned from
her tall, deeply tanned, uniformed escort to address the servant
who had let them in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be needing you tonight, Tullia. You may go now.
But wait ... before you leave, we shan&rsquo;t be wanting all these
lamps. Put out all but that one&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed&mdash;&ldquo;and then you
may go to bed. Poor thing, I know you&rsquo;re tired.&rdquo; She peered
beyond the wide archway opening onto the peristylium. &ldquo;I see
you left a lamp burning in my bedroom. Good. Well, then, just
put these others out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do without her,&rdquo; Claudia said as the
servant snuffed out the flame and, bowing to them, disappeared
into the now darkened corridor. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a treasure, Longinus, intelligent,
faithful, and, most important, she&rsquo;s utterly loyal. She
would die before betraying me. She&rsquo;s Phoebe&rsquo;s daughter, and
Phoebe, you know, hanged herself rather than be a witness against
my mother. Tullia, I&rsquo;m sure, would do the same thing for me.&rdquo;
She pointed toward the peristylium. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit out there in the
moonlight. It seems a little warm in here, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I was hoping you&rsquo;d suggest that. It
would be a shame to waste that moon, and the fountain and
flowers.&rdquo; He was glancing around the luxuriously furnished room.
&ldquo;By the gods, Claudia, you have a handsome place. It&rsquo;s been a
long time since I was here, but it seems more lavish. Did Aemilius
have it redecorated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bona Dea, no. That insipid oaf? What has he ever done for
me?&rdquo; She acted mildly piqued but then smiled. &ldquo;It has been redecorated,
but I had it done. This apartment&rsquo;s actually an extension
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
of the Imperial Palace, you remember. My beloved stepfather,
the great Emperor Tiberius,&rdquo; she said sarcastically, &ldquo;had it
built for his little girls. When he moved them out to Capri with
him&mdash;a new group, of course, for several of us were too old by
then&mdash;he allowed me to stay here. But I moved away when I
married Aemilius; we went out to Baiae. After we were divorced,
though, I returned here, and that&rsquo;s when I had it redecorated.
But the place was built for the Emperor&rsquo;s little girls.&rdquo; She paused,
leaned against a high-backed bronze chair. &ldquo;You understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard stories, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when poor Mother sent me to him from Pandateria&mdash;you
know I was born on that dreadful island soon after Grandfather
Augustus banished her there, and I really think she sent me
to Tiberius to see that I got away from it. Anyway, he put me in
here with the other little girls. This wing connects with his private
quarters, or once did. There&rsquo;s a wing very much like this one on
the other side; that&rsquo;s where he kept his boys.&rdquo; She shrugged; he
sensed that it was more a shudder. &ldquo;Tiberius, thank the gods,
spent more time over on the boys&rsquo; side. There&rsquo;s a small passage-way&mdash;few
persons probably know about it now&mdash;that opened from
his quarters into my dressing room. It was all quite convenient.
But when the old monster moved out to Capri, I had the door
removed and the opening bricked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard stories about the Emperor. Was he ... did he
really ... I mean, you know, Claudia, did he actually do ...
does he, I mean...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed. &ldquo;Yes, he did. And I presume he still does; they
say old men are worse that way than young men. But he no longer
bothers me and hasn&rsquo;t for years. I&rsquo;m much too old for him; he
likes them very young, or did. He&rsquo;s an old rake, all right, though
he can&rsquo;t be guilty of all the things they&rsquo;ve charged him with. Out
at Capri now I really think he&rsquo;s more interested in his astrologers
and philosophers than in his little girls and his painted pretty
boys. But, well&rdquo;&mdash;she shrugged&mdash;&ldquo;there are things I do know about
him, experiences I myself have had with him, and although I&rsquo;m
not close blood kin to him, my mother, poor thing, was his wife
though she was that only because her father forced her to marry
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
him.&rdquo; They had crossed into the peristylium, and she paused to
face him, smiling. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s talk no more of the Emperor and me,
Longinus; by the gods, there are pleasanter subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree; there are pleasanter subjects than Tiberius.&rdquo; They
walked around a tall potted plant and sat down. Claudia leaned
back against the plush cushions of the couch; she pushed her
jewel-studded golden sandals out from beneath the folds of her
white silk stola. The moonlight danced in the jeweled clasps that
fastened the straps above her shoulders, while the gold mesh of
her girdle glittered brightly. For a moment she silently studied the
fountain. Then suddenly she sat forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Longinus. Would you like some wine and perhaps
a wafer? I have some excellent Campania, both Falernian and
Surrentine, in the other room. Or perhaps you&rsquo;re hungry....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Claudia, thank you. I made a pig of myself at Herod&rsquo;s
dinner tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was a lavish banquet, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Her smile indicated
a sudden secret amusement. &ldquo;I wonder what Sejanus will think
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sejanus?&rdquo; Then he smiled with her. &ldquo;Oh, I see what you mean.
He&rsquo;s going to wonder where Herod got the money. And why
Herod gave the dinner for Herodias.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia laughed. &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s his favorite niece, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She surely must be. But she&rsquo;s also his half brother&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
Longinus paused thoughtfully. &ldquo;I hardly think, however, that
Sejanus will be greatly concerned with the domestic affairs of the
Herods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as they keep the money flowing into his treasury,
hmm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And you&rsquo;re right. Tonight&rsquo;s lavish feast may cause the
Prefect to suspect that the flow is being partially diverted. Our
friend Herod Antipas ought to have given a more modest affair.
No doubt he was trying, though, to impress Herodias.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; Claudia repeated. &ldquo;But it was hardly necessary.
She wants to marry him and be Tetrarchess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus looked surprised. &ldquo;Then you think Antipas will take
her away from Philip?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he will. He already has, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the gods, that&rsquo;s odd. That Arabian woman he left in
Tiberias is much more beautiful. And so is that Jewish woman
he brought along with him to Rome. What did you say her name
was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed you had eyes for her all evening.&rdquo; Claudia&rsquo;s tone, he
thought, was not altogether flippant, and that pleased him. &ldquo;Her
name&rsquo;s Mary,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and she lives at Magdala on the
Sea of Galilee just above Tiberias. But of course you know where
Tiberias is. And I suspect you might remember Mary.&rdquo; Her smile
was coy and slyly questioning. &ldquo;Herodias says that this Mary is
being pursued by half the wealthy men in Galilee for the artistry
with which she performs her bedroom chores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must confess&rdquo;&mdash;Longinus grinned&mdash;&ldquo;that unfortunately I am
numbered among the other half. But what does Herodias think of
her beloved uncle&rsquo;s amours? Isn&rsquo;t she jealous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure she is ... what woman wouldn&rsquo;t be? But she
knows that in such activities she must share him. Antipas, I understand,
is a true Herod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I have a strong suspicion that in such activities, as
you express it, Herodias is a Herod, too.&rdquo; He sat forward, serious
again. &ldquo;But what puzzles me, Claudia, is how I happened to be one
of Antipas&rsquo; guests tonight. It must have been entirely through
your arranging, but why on earth are you involved in a social way
with any of these Jews?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia laughed. &ldquo;Herodias and I have long been friends. You
see, after her grandfather, old Herod the Great they called him,
had her father and her uncle, his own sons, killed&rdquo;&mdash;she involuntarily
shuddered&mdash;&ldquo;Herodias and her brother Agrippa were virtually
brought up at the Emperor&rsquo;s court. Agrippa&rsquo;s a spoiled, arrogant,
worthless spendthrift. Old Herod sent his other sons to
Rome, too, to be educated&mdash;Antipas and Philip, Herodias&rsquo; husband
now, and still another Philip....&rdquo; She broke off and gestured to
indicate futility. &ldquo;You see, Longinus, old Herod had ten wives
and only the gods know how many children and grandchildren
and great-grandchildren. Do you know much about the Herods?
They&rsquo;re older than we, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Longinus shook his head. &ldquo;No, nor do I care to. I think maybe
I have seen some of them a few times, including this Philip, but
I happily surrender to you any share I may have in any Jew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Longinus, the Herods aren&rsquo;t orthodox Jews. They even
say that some of them, including Herodias and her no-good brother,
are more Roman than we Romans. They&rsquo;ve all probably spent
more time in Rome than in Palestine. Why, they have about as
much regard for the Jewish religion as you and I have for our
Roman gods. Actually, Longinus, the Herods are Idumaeans, and
they&rsquo;re quite different from the rest of the Jews. The Jews are
strict in their religious observances.&rdquo; Abruptly she stopped. &ldquo;But
why, Bona Dea, am I telling you about the Jews? You have lived
out there in Palestine, and I&rsquo;ve never set foot near it. Your father
has vast properties in that region, while mine....&rdquo; She lifted a
knee to the couch as she twisted her body to face him, her dark
eyes deadly serious in the silver brightness of the moon. &ldquo;Longinus,
do you know about my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Claudia, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She smiled bitterly. &ldquo;That was a silly
question. I don&rsquo;t even know myself. I&rsquo;ve often wondered if Mother
did. But haven&rsquo;t you heard stories, Longinus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was rather young, remember, when you were born.&rdquo; But
immediately he was serious. &ldquo;Gossip, Claudia, yes. I&rsquo;ve heard people
talk. But gossip has never interested me.&rdquo; A sly grin lightened
his expression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more interested in your father&rsquo;s handiwork
than in who he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prettily said, Centurion.&rdquo; She patted the back of his bronzed
hand. &ldquo;But surely you must have heard that my father was the
son of Mark Antony and Cleopatra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I believe I have. But why...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that my other grandfather, the Emperor Augustus, had
him killed when he got Mother pregnant with me and then
banished her to that damnably barren Pandateria?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have heard something about it, Claudia, but what of it?
What difference does it make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that it makes no difference to you
that I&rsquo;m a bastard, Longinus, and the discarded plaything of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
lecherous old man, even though that lecherous old man happens
to be the second Emperor of Rome? Does it make no difference
to a son of the distinguished Tullius clan...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t your slave maid, too, a member of this distinguished
Tullius clan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His quick parrying of the question amused her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of Tullia that way. Her grandfather
belonged to one of the Tullii, no doubt. But Tullia is actually
not Roman; she&rsquo;s Jewish. Her grandfather was one of those Jews
brought as slaves from Jerusalem by Pompey. Tullia is even faithful
to the Jewish religion. But that&rsquo;s her only fault, and it&rsquo;s one
I&rsquo;m glad to overlook. Sometimes I allow her to go to one of the
synagogues over in the Janiculum Hill section.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus reached for her hand. &ldquo;Nevertheless, Claudia, you
must know that many so-called distinguished Romans are legitimate
only because their mothers happened to be married, though
not to their fathers, when they were conceived?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so. No doubt you&rsquo;ve heard the story of what
Mother said to a friend who asked her one day how all five of the
children she had during the time she was married to General
Agrippa happened to look so much like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have, I don&rsquo;t recall it. What was her answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never take on a passenger unless the vessel is already full.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see how that would be effective,&rdquo; the centurion observed
dryly. &ldquo;But then how do you explain ... well, yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After General Agrippa died, Augustus made Tiberius divorce
his wife and marry Mother. But they were totally incompatible,
and I can see how, under the circumstances, things turned out
the way they did. Tiberius left Rome and went out to Rhodes
to live. That pleased Mother; she was young and beautiful, and
she was still the most sought-after of her set in Rome. So, after
Tiberius hadn&rsquo;t been near her bed for years and a succession of
more interesting men had, it was discovered, to the horror of my
conventional and publicly pious grandfather and the delight of
Rome&rsquo;s gossips, that I was expected. So the Emperor had the
man who was supposed to be my father&rdquo;&mdash;she smiled&mdash;&ldquo;you know,
I&rsquo;ve always rather hoped he was&mdash;he had him executed, and he
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
sent Mother off to Pandateria.&rdquo; She threw out her hands, palms
up. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the story of Mother&rsquo;s misfortune, me. But you must
have heard about all this years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ignored her question. &ldquo;You her misfortune? Don&rsquo;t be silly.
You were rather, I&rsquo;d say, her gift to Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do put things prettily, Longinus. Nevertheless, my mother
was banished because of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, by the gods, how could you help it, Claudia?&rdquo; He caught
her chin and turned her face around so that the moon shone full
upon it. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you still the granddaughter of the first Emperor
of Rome on one side and a queen and triumvir on the other?
Aren&rsquo;t you still the stepdaughter of the Emperor Tiberius? Those
are distinguished bloodlines, by Jove! What nobler heritage could
anyone have? And aren&rsquo;t you the most beautiful woman in Rome?
What, by mighty Jupiter, Claudia, do you lack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the moment,&rdquo; she answered, her serious air suddenly vanished,
&ldquo;a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A situation you could quickly remedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A situation that Tiberius or Sejanus could quickly remedy, you
mean, and may attempt to do soon, and not to my liking, I suspect.
They may even pick another Aemilius for me, the gods
forbid. Seriously, Longinus, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to learn right
now that Sejanus has already arranged it. He and the Emperor
are desperately afraid, I suspect, that I may scandalize Rome, as
Mother did, if they don&rsquo;t get me married quickly before I have
a baby and no husband to blame it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Claudia....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Bountiful Mother, Longinus,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
expecting, if that&rsquo;s what you think. And what&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t expect
to be expecting ... any time soon. But I know Sejanus,
and I know Tiberius. It&rsquo;s all politics, Centurion. And politics must
be served, just as it was served in my grandfather&rsquo;s day and at
every other time since man first knew the taste of power. The
same hypocritical public behavior, the same affected virtues
propped right alongside the same winked-at corruption.&rdquo; She
swung her legs around and stood up. &ldquo;But enough of this speech-making.
I&rsquo;m going to bring us some of the Campania.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>She returned with the wine on a silver tray and handed him
one of the two slender goblets. He held the glass up to the light
and slowly revolved its gracefully thin stem between his thumb
and forefinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like Campania?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the glass that interests
me. This goblet comes from my father&rsquo;s plant near Tyre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad. I knew they were made
in Phoenicia, but I didn&rsquo;t know they came from Senator Piso&rsquo;s
glassworks. Herodias gave me several pieces from a set Antipas
brought her. They are lovely.&rdquo; She lifted her own goblet and admired
it in the moonlight. &ldquo;Such beautiful craftsmanship. You
know, I&rsquo;ve never understood how they can be blown so perfectly.
And I love the delicate coloring. Now that I know they come
from your father&rsquo;s factory, they&rsquo;re all the more interesting to me,
and valued.&rdquo; She set the goblet down and sat quietly for a moment
studying the resplendent full moon. &ldquo;Longinus, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re
back in Rome,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;It seems you&rsquo;ve been away in
Germania, and before that in Palestine, for such a long time. Did
you ever think of me while you were away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And did you ... of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, often, and very much. In spite of Aemilius.&rdquo; She
picked up the goblet, then set it down again on the tripod and
leaned against his shoulder. &ldquo;By the Bountiful Mother Ceres&rdquo;&mdash;she
bent forward, slipping her feet out of the sandals&mdash;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get
comfortable, Longinus. I&rsquo;m too warm. This stola&rsquo;s heavy, and I&rsquo;m
so ... so laced.&rdquo; She stood up. &ldquo;Wait here; I&rsquo;ll only be a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diagonally across from them a thin sliver of lamplight shone
through a crack in the doorway to Claudia&rsquo;s bedroom. She stepped
into her sandals, walked around the spraying fountain, and entered
the room. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t close the door entirely,&rdquo; she called back, as
she swung it three-fourths shut. &ldquo;That way we can talk while I&rsquo;m
getting into something more comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really should be going,&rdquo; Longinus said. &ldquo;I have early duty
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not yet, please. Do wait. I&rsquo;ll be out in a moment. Pour
yourself some wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He poured another glass, sipped from it, then set the goblet on
the tray and settled back against the cushions. His gaze returned
to the widened rectangle of light in her doorway. In the center of
it there was a sudden movement. Surely, he thought, she isn&rsquo;t going
to change directly in front of the open door. Then he realized
that he was looking into a long mirror on the wall at right angles
to the doorway; he was seeing her image in the polished bronze. In
stepping back from the door she had taken a position in the
corner of the room just at the spot where the angle was right for
the mirror to reflect her image to anyone seated on the couch
outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the gods!&rdquo; Longinus sat forward.</p>
<p>But now she had disappeared. The mirror showed only a corner
of her dressing table with its profusion of containers&mdash;vials of perfumes,
oils, ointments, jars of creams&mdash;and scissors, tweezers,
strigils, razors, he presumed them to be, though because of the
distance from them and the table&rsquo;s disarray he could not see them
clearly. Now they were suddenly hidden behind the brightness of
the stola as the young woman again came into view. She dropped
a garment across a chair, then turned to face the dressing table
and the mirror above it. The light shone full upon her back. Both
stola and girdle behind were cut low, and the cold shimmering
whiteness of the gown accentuated the smooth warmth of her
flesh tones. Now her fingers were busy at the jeweled fastenings
of the girdle; the light flashed in the stones of her rings. Quickly
the girdle came off, and her hands went to one shoulder as her
bracelets, their stones glimmering, slipped along her arms. The
clasp gave; the strap fell to reveal warm flesh to her waist. She
unfastened the other strap, and the stola slipped to the floor.
Bending quickly, she picked up the voluminous garment and, turning,
laid it with the girdle across the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;By all the great gods!&rdquo; In the strong
but flickering light of the wall lamp, Claudia stood divested now
of all her clothing except for the sheer black silk of her scant
undergarments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you still there, Longinus?&rdquo; she called out. &ldquo;And did I
hear you say something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But really, Claudia, I should be
going.&rdquo; He hoped his voice did not betray his suddenly mounting
tension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet. Just a minute. I&rsquo;m coming now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached for a dressing robe and hurriedly swept it around
her. Fastening the belt loosely about her waist, she turned toward
the doorway and stepped quickly back into the peristylium. He
stood up to meet her. Gently she pushed him to the couch and
sat beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t go yet, Longinus. You&rsquo;ve been away in Germania
so long, and I couldn&rsquo;t have you to myself at the banquet. There&rsquo;s
so much to talk about, to ask you about.&rdquo; She leaned back and
snuggled against him. Then she looked down at her knees, round
and pink under the sheerness of the pale rose robe. &ldquo;Bona Dea!&rdquo;
She clamped her knees together and doubled the robe over them.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize this robe was so transparent, Longinus. But it is
comfortable, and there is only the moonlight out here.&rdquo; She
reached out, caught his hand, squeezed it, and released it. &ldquo;And
you can lean back and look only at the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in Germania we had the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and women. I&rsquo;ve heard much about the women of Germania,
and seen them, too. Women with yellow hair and complexions
like the bloom of the apricot or the skin of the pomegranate.
And women free for the asking, eh, Centurion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not often for the asking. Sometimes for the taking.&rdquo; He pulled
her close and felt through his tunic the quick surge of her warmth
against him. &ldquo;But tonight is not Germania and women whose hair
is the color of ripening grain, Claudia. Tonight is Rome and a
woman with hair as black as a raven&rsquo;s wing and skin fair and
smooth and warm and greatly tempting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman maybe for the asking, or the taking?&rdquo; Quickly she
twisted out from the arm about her waist, and her gay, impish
laughter broke upon the fountain&rsquo;s sleepy murmuring. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know you were also a poet, Longinus.&rdquo; She reached for the pitcher.
&ldquo;Wine to toast the weaver of beautiful words,&rdquo; she said, filling
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
the goblets; she handed him his, then held hers aloft. &ldquo;I drink
to the new Catullus. &lsquo;Let us live, Lesbia mine, and love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he say it...?</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And all the mumbling of harsh old men</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We shall reckon as a pennyworth.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then, well....</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Give me a thousand kisses, then a hundred,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Then another thousand, then a second hundred,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And still another thousand, then a hundred.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It goes on,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s all I can repeat. Now drink
with me to your own pretty words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus laughed and sipped the wine. &ldquo;Were his words quoted
by you for me ... from you? Remember that Catullus later
wrote of his Lesbia:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s words to hungry lover said</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Should be upon the flowing winds inscribed,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Upon swift streams engraved.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>She leaned out from the shadow into which the retreating moon
had pushed them. &ldquo;Maybe they were quoted to spur your asking,
Longinus, or&rdquo;&mdash;she paused and smiled demurely&mdash;&ldquo;your taking.&rdquo;
Then quickly she sank back against him. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m
a blatantly bold hussy, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Claudia,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;just experienced. And beautiful, and
... and very tempting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Experienced, yes, but believe me, not promiscuous, Longinus.
By the Bountiful Mother, I&rsquo;m not that way, in spite of my experience.&rdquo;
The teasing was gone from her eyes. &ldquo;In spite of everything,
not that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She snuggled against his arm outstretched along the back of
the couch, and gently he half turned her to let her head down
upon his lap. Her eyes were wide, and in each he saw a luminous
and trembling small, round moon; her mouth was open, and against
his thigh he felt the quickened pounding of her heart. As he bent
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
over her, she reached up and drew him, her hot palm cupping the
back of his cropped head, down hard upon her lips tasting sweet
of the Campania and desperately eager and burning.</p>
<p>He raised his face from hers and lifted her slightly to relieve
the pressure of her body on his arm. She drew up her feet and,
with knees bent, braced them against the end of the short couch.
Her robe slipped open, and she lay still, her eyes closed, her lips
apart.</p>
<p>His throat tightened, and he felt a prickling sensation moving
up and down his spine, coursing outward to his arms and past
tingling palms to his fingertips. Deftly he eased his legs from
beneath her; lowering her head to the couch, he stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Longinus, please, not now,&rdquo; she pleaded, her voice tense,
her tone entreating. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t leave me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he stood above her, silent, and then, bending
down quickly, he lifted her from the couch and started toward
the still open bedroom door. He was past the fountain when a
sudden, loud knocking at the entrance doors shattered the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Longinus, put me down!&rdquo; She swung her legs to the
floor. &ldquo;Bona Dea, who could be coming here at this hour! Of all
the damnable luck!&rdquo; She stared in dismay at her disarrayed and
transparent robe. &ldquo;By all the gods, I can&rsquo;t go into the atrium
dressed like this! Longinus, will you go? Tullia&rsquo;s probably sound
asleep.&rdquo; With that, Claudia darted into the bedroom, while the
pounding grew ever louder and more insistent.</p>
<p>Longinus started toward the door, but before he could reach
it, Tullia had appeared from the corridor. She quickly opened
the door, then backed away as the robust soldier stepped inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am seeking the Centurion Longinus. I was told ... ah,
there you are!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cornelius! What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longinus! By Jove! I&rsquo;ve been searching all Rome for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you were still in Palestine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I thought you were still in Germania!&rdquo;&mdash;Cornelius
laughed&mdash;&ldquo;until today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, sit down,&rdquo; Longinus said. &ldquo;When did you get back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a week ago, and most of that time I&rsquo;ve been out at Baiae
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
with the family. I came into Rome today to report to the Prefect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jove! Is he going to name you Procurator of Judaea, Cornelius?
I hear that Valerius Gratus is being recalled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me Procurator? Don&rsquo;t be silly, man. No, but I have an idea
it&rsquo;s something concerned with Palestine that has him calling for
you. I&rsquo;ve got orders to find you and bring you to his palace immediately.
So we&rsquo;d best be going, Longinus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see Sejanus? At this hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he said it was urgent. He&rsquo;s leaving early tomorrow morning
for Capri, and he says he&rsquo;s got to see you before he goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the gods!&rdquo; Longinus&rsquo; countenance was suddenly solemn.
&ldquo;What have <i>I</i> done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s nothing to be alarmed about. Probably some
special assignment or other. I don&rsquo;t know. But come, man, you
know Sejanus doesn&rsquo;t like to be kept waiting. Get your toga. I
have a sedan chair outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a minute, Cornelius. I must tell Claudia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t her maid explain...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Longinus already was striding toward the peristylium.
&ldquo;Claudia,&rdquo; he called through the crack in the doorway, &ldquo;the Prefect
has sent for me. I don&rsquo;t know what he wants, but I&rsquo;ve got to
be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bona Dea!&rdquo; She was just inside the door. &ldquo;Sejanus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Cornelius says he wants to see me tonight, right now. I
don&rsquo;t have any idea what he could want, but tomorrow night, if I
may see you then, I&rsquo;ll explain everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could that old devil be wanting with you, Longinus?&rdquo;
The question seemed addressed more to herself than to him. &ldquo;Yes,
of course, you must come. I&rsquo;ll be anxious to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of his retreating steps echoed along the peristylium
and across the mosaic floor of the atrium. Claudia listened until
she heard Tullia shut the double doors, and then there was silence.
She closed her own door and crossed to her still undisturbed
bed; she flung herself upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sejanus, the devil! The old devil!&rdquo; With furious fists she
pounded on the bed. &ldquo;May Pluto&rsquo;s mallet splatter his evil brains!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Centurion Longinus, how well do you know Pontius Pilate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prefect Sejanus sensed that the soldier was hardly prepared
for the blunt question. He had only a moment ago entered the
ornate chamber. But Sejanus added nothing to qualify the question.
Instead, he seemed to enjoy Longinus&rsquo; momentary uneasiness.
His small eyes reflected the light from the lamps flanking the
heavy oak desk behind which he sat, while he waited for the centurion
to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Longinus at last began, &ldquo;during our campaign in Germania
he commanded the cohort of which my century was a unit,
but I cannot say that I know him well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you and Pontius Pilate&rdquo;&mdash;the Prefect paused and smiled
blandly&mdash;&ldquo;could hardly be described as devoted friends or intimates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, sir, and I am not sure that Pilate....&rdquo; He hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please speak frankly, Centurion.&rdquo; The Prefect&rsquo;s smile was disarmingly
reassuring. &ldquo;You were about to say, were you not, that
you are not sure that Pilate has many intimate friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to say, sir, that in my opinion Pilate is not the
type of soldier who has many intimate friends. I may be doing
him an injustice, but I have never considered him a particularly
... ah ... sociable fellow. I have the feeling that he is a very
ambitious man, determined to advance his career....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his private fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus thought carefully before answering. &ldquo;So far as that is
concerned, sir, I really cannot say. I have no information whatever
on which to base an opinion. Nor did I intend to indicate in any
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
way that I thought Pilate was seeking advancement in the army
in an improper manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sejanus sat back in his chair. His falcon-like eyes darted back
and forth as they measured and appraised the young man. &ldquo;Centurion,&rdquo;
he said, leaning forward and smiling ingratiatingly, &ldquo;you
are cautious, and you evidence a sense of loyalty to your superiors.
Both qualities I admire, particularly in the soldier. This
makes me all the more confident that you will be able to carry
out the assignment I propose to give you.&rdquo; He stared unblinkingly
into the centurion&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Longinus, no doubt you have been
wondering why I sent for you, why I insisted you come at this
late hour, and why we are closeted here alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I have been wondering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is irregular, of course, even though it is with the son of
Senator Marcus Tullius Piso that the Prefect is closeted.&rdquo; The
wry smile was gone now; the Prefect&rsquo;s countenance was serious.
&ldquo;Longinus, you must be aware of the regard your father and I
have for each other. You must know that we also understand
each other, that we are colleagues in various enterprises widely
scattered about the Empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, sir, that my father has a high regard for the Prefect,
and I have known in a vague way of your association in certain
business enterprises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they have been profitable to both of us, Longinus.
Have you ever wondered, for instance, how it happens that whenever
your father&rsquo;s plants in Phoenicia begin to run low on slaves,
a government ship always arrives with fresh ones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus nodded. &ldquo;Whenever such a vessel arrived, I always
thought I knew why. But I never asked questions or ventured
comments, sir. I just put the new slaves to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent. You are discreet, indeed. There is nothing more
valuable to me than an intelligent man who can keep his eyes
open and his mouth closed.&rdquo; Sejanus arose, came around the desk
to sit in a chair at arm&rsquo;s length from the centurion. &ldquo;Longinus,
the assignment I propose to give you is of immense importance.
And it is highly confidential in nature.&rdquo; His expression and voice
were grave. &ldquo;To accomplish it successfully, the man I choose will
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
have to be always on the alert; he will have to have imagination
and initiative; he will need to exercise great caution; and above
all, he will have to be someone completely loyal to the Prefect.&rdquo;
For a long moment his quickly darting eyes appraised the soldier.
&ldquo;I know that you are intelligent, Longinus, and I am satisfied
that you possess these other qualities.&rdquo; He leaned forward and
tapped the centurion on the knee. &ldquo;I had a purpose in asking
you if you knew Pontius Pilate well. Tomorrow Pilate is to see me.
If everything goes as I expect, then we shall start for Capri to see
the Emperor, and the Emperor will approve officially what I
shall have done already.&rdquo; He paused and smiled cynically. &ldquo;You
understand, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus smiled. &ldquo;I believe, sir, that you speak for the Emperor
in such matters, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all matters, Longinus. The Emperor no longer concerns
himself with the affairs of the Empire.&rdquo; His piggish eyes brightened.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too busy with his astrologers and his philosophers and
his&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled with contempt&mdash;&ldquo;his friends.&rdquo; But suddenly the
contemptuous smile was gone, and Sejanus sat back in his chair.
&ldquo;Longinus, Pontius Pilate is anxious to succeed Valerius Gratus
as Procurator of Judaea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The centurion sensed that the Prefect was waiting for his reaction.
But he said nothing. Sejanus leaned forward again. &ldquo;I am
speaking in complete frankness, Longinus. We must understand
each other; you must likewise speak frankly to me. But what we
say must go no further. Is that clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Now to get back to Pilate. He&rsquo;s a man well suited to
my purpose, I&rsquo;m confident.&rdquo; Once more the Prefect hesitated, as
if seeking a way to proceed. &ldquo;Some years ago, before you went
out to Phoenicia, the Emperor&rsquo;s nephew, General Germanicus, was
fatally poisoned at Alexandria. It was rumored at the time that the
Emperor had ordered it. Pilate, who served in Gaul under Germanicus,
came stoutly to the Emperor&rsquo;s defense with the story
that the poisoning had been done by supporters of the Emperor
but without his knowledge, because they had learned that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
nephew was plotting the uncle&rsquo;s downfall. Perhaps you heard
something about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I did hear something to that effect, sir. But that was
about seven years ago, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, no doubt. Time passes so fast for me, Centurion. But let&rsquo;s
get back to Pontius Pilate. He&rsquo;s ambitious, as you suggested, and
as I said, he wants to be appointed Procurator in Judaea. So he
should be amenable to ... ah, suggestions, eh, Centurion? And
he should therefore be a perfect counterpart in Judaea to the
Tetrarch Antipas in Galilee.&rdquo; Sejanus suddenly was staring intently
at the sober-faced young soldier. &ldquo;How well, Longinus, do
you know Herod Antipas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know him at all, sir. I&rsquo;ve seen him a few times; I used
to go into Galilee and other parts of Palestine for our glassware
plants; I tried once, I remember, to sell him glassware for the new
palace he was building on the Sea of Galilee. But those were business
trips, you see, and I rarely saw him even then. I was usually
directed to speak with the Tetrarchess or Herod&rsquo;s steward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were a guest at the banquet he gave this evening,
weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was, sir.&rdquo; Longinus wondered, almost admiringly, how the
Prefect managed to keep so well-informed of even the most private
goings-on in Rome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a sumptuous feast, no doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was quite lavish, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmmm. I must remember that.&rdquo; The Prefect puckered his lips,
and his forehead wrinkled into a frown. Leaning across the desk,
he drew his lips tightly against his teeth. &ldquo;Soon, Longinus, you
will be having two to watch.&rdquo; His eyes narrowed to a squint.
&ldquo;Three, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To watch, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the assignment I have for you, Longinus. I am
sending you out to Palestine, to be my eyes and ears in the land
of those pestiferous Jews. At intervals you will report&rdquo;&mdash;he held
up his hand, palm out&mdash;&ldquo;but only to me, understand. You will
travel about the various areas&mdash;Caesarea, Jerusalem, Tiberias, to
your father&rsquo;s plants in Phoenicia, perhaps other places&mdash;ostensibly
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
on routine tasks for the army. The details will be worked out
later.&rdquo; He leveled a forefinger at the centurion. &ldquo;It will be your
task, among the various duties you will have, Centurion, to report
to me any suspicions that may be aroused in your mind concerning
the flow of revenues into the Imperial treasury in accordance
with the terms that I shall make with Pontius Pilate, and likewise
with the revised schedules I shall&rdquo;&mdash;he paused an instant, and his
smile was sardonic&mdash;&ldquo;suggest to the Tetrarch Antipas before he returns
to Galilee.&rdquo; He sat back, and his sharp small eyes studied
Longinus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, as I understand it, you are suspicious that both Pilate
and Antipas may withhold for themselves money that should be
going to Rome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put it this way, Longinus.&rdquo; The Prefect leaned toward
the centurion and tapped the desk with the ends of his fingers.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust them. I know the Tetrarch has been dipping his fat
hand into the treasury, though not too heavily thus far, let us say.
That white marble palace at the seaside, for example, and the
gorgeous furnishings, including Phoenician glassware, eh?&rdquo; He shot
a quizzical straight glance into the centurion&rsquo;s eyes, but quickly a
smile tempered it. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t object to his buying glass, do we, as
long as it comes from your father&rsquo;s plants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just as quickly the Prefect was serious again. He sat back
against the leather and put his hands together, fingertips to fingertips.
&ldquo;Herod Antipas wants to be a Herod the Great,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;But he hasn&rsquo;t the character his father had. By character, Centurion,
I mean courage, stamina, strength, and ability, yes. Old
Herod was a villain, mean, blackhearted, cold-blooded, murderous.
But he was an able man, strong, a great administrator, a brave and
brilliant soldier, every inch a ruler. Beside him, his son is a weakling.
Herodias, on the other hand, is more like her grandfather
than Antipas is like his father. She&rsquo;s ambitious, vain, demanding.
She is continually pushing Antipas. She seeks advancement, more
power, more of the trappings of royalty.&rdquo; He lifted a forefinger
and shook it before the centurion. &ldquo;Herodias will likely bring
ruin upon both of them.&rdquo; Then he paused, thoughtful. &ldquo;But so
much for Antipas. Watch him, Longinus. If he&rdquo;&mdash;his expression
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
warmed with a disarming smile&mdash;&ldquo;buys too much of that Phoenician
glass, then let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, sir.&rdquo; Longinus was smiling, too. Then he was serious.
&ldquo;But, sir, you were speaking also of Pontius Pilate....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I think Pilate is the man I want for Judaea. But I don&rsquo;t
trust him either. I want him watched closely, Longinus. I suspect
that his fingers will be itching, likewise, to dip too deeply into
the till.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, if you can&rsquo;t trust him....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why then am I sending him out there?&rdquo; The Prefect laughed
cynically. Then he sobered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a proper question, my boy. We
must be frank, as I said. I&rsquo;ve told you that I believe Pilate will be
amenable to suggestions. Like Antipas, he, too, is a weakling. He
has a good record as a soldier, but always as a subordinate. I question
whether he has the courage, the stamina, to lead and rule. He
will be looking to Rome, I believe, for direction. And he will always
be fearful of displeasing the Prefect. But at the same time,
Longinus, I think he will be looking for ways of adding to his
personal wealth. So he will bleed those Jews to get all Rome requires
and some for his own pocket as well.&rdquo; He paused, thoughtful
for a moment. &ldquo;Yes, I believe Pontius Pilate is the man I want.
Certainly I shall give him a chance to prove himself.&rdquo; Quickly he
raised an emphatic finger. &ldquo;But I want you to watch him, Longinus.
I want you to ascertain whether any diversions are being made
in the flow of the tax revenues to the Imperial treasury, and if so,
to report it to me. Even if you have no proof, but only strong
suspicions to go on, by all means report them too. I&rsquo;ll work out a
plan whereby you can make the reports confidentially and
quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prefect paused, leaned back in his chair, and calmly studied
the younger man. When Longinus ventured no comment, Sejanus
continued with his instructions. &ldquo;You will be transferred from your
present cohort to the Second Italian. Your rank will remain the
same; as a centurion you will be more useful to me, since you will
be less observed and therefore less suspected in this lower grade.
But you will be properly compensated, Longinus, with the extent
of the compensation being governed in great part, let us say&rdquo;&mdash;he
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
puckered his lips again&mdash;&ldquo;upon the degree of functioning of your
eyes and ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sejanus arose, and Longinus stood with him. &ldquo;You have made
no comment, Centurion Longinus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I am at the Prefect&rsquo;s command. But may I ask when I am
to be given further instructions and when I shall be sailing for
Palestine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon, Centurion, as quickly as I can arrange it. I would like
you to go out ahead of Pilate and be there when he arrives at
Caesarea. It will be important to observe how he takes over the
duties of the post from the outset. I shall summon you when I am
ready and give you full instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The audience with the Prefect was at an end. At the door, as
he was about to step into the corridor, Longinus paused. &ldquo;Sir, a
moment ago you said there would be three for me to watch. You
spoke of Pilate and Herod Antipas. Who is the third?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sejanus smiled blandly and rubbed his hands together. &ldquo;The
third, ah, yes.&rdquo; His black small eyes danced. &ldquo;And there will be
others also. But you need not concern yourself with any of this
detail at the moment. When I have completed my plans, as I&rsquo;ve
said, I shall summon you here and instruct you fully.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c3">3</h2>
<p>Longinus sat up in bed, thrust forth an arm to peel back his side
of the covering sheet, pulled up his feet, and twisted around to
plant them evenly on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jove!&rdquo; He craned his neck, blinked his still heavy eyelids, and
strained to rub the cramped muscles at his shoulder blades. From
the northeast, rolling down through the gentle depression dividing
the mansion-studded slopes of the Viminal and Quirinal Hills,
came the fading plaintively sweet notes of a trumpet. He glanced
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
toward the window; the light was already beginning to sift through
slits in the drawn draperies.</p>
<p>Claudia opened her eyes. She pushed herself up to a sitting
position. &ldquo;Are you going, Longinus? Must you be leaving so early?&rdquo;
She rubbed her eyes and squinted into the slowly brightening window.
&ldquo;Do you have to...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning watch at Castra Praetoria,&rdquo; he explained, nodding
in the direction of the window. &ldquo;It awakened me, luckily. I
must be out there before the next call is sounded. Today I&rsquo;m on
early duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always have to be going.&rdquo; Her lips, the rouge smeared but
still red, were pouting. &ldquo;You hardly get here, and then you say
you must be leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, by the gods, Claudia, I&rsquo;ve been here all night, remember.&rdquo;
He pinched her chin. &ldquo;I had dinner with you, and I haven&rsquo;t left
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right. But if you must go, you&rsquo;d best be dressing. Although,
really, Longinus, can&rsquo;t you stay a few minutes longer, just
a few? Please.&rdquo; She slid back to lie in a stretched position, her
figure clearly outlined beneath the light covering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Temptress! By the gods, I wish I could.&rdquo; He bent down and
kissed her smeared lips. &ldquo;Well, at least it won&rsquo;t be like this when
we get to Palestine. Out there I&rsquo;ll be able to arrange my own
schedule, and there&rsquo;ll be no early morning duty then. But by great
Jove, I&rsquo;ve got to be going now.&rdquo; He stood up and walked to the
chair on which his clothing lay. &ldquo;Today I&rsquo;ll begin getting preparations
made so that we can be ready to sail when Sejanus gives me
his final orders. And the preparations will include arrangements for
our wedding,&rdquo; he concluded, grinning.</p>
<p>Languidly she lay back and watched him as he dressed. &ldquo;Longinus,&rdquo;
she said, as he finished latching his boots, &ldquo;do you really
believe that your father will be willing to let you marry me?&rdquo; Her
expression indicated concern. &ldquo;I have no doubt but that my beloved
stepfather will be quite willing, quite happy, in fact, because
I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s already anxious to be freed of the responsibility he
has, or thinks he has, for me. But I do wonder about Senator
Piso.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the great and little gods, Claudia, it&rsquo;s not the senator you&rsquo;re
marrying, remember? <i>I&rsquo;m</i> the one,&rdquo; he said, thumping his chest
with stiffened thumb. &ldquo;Me, understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, silly man.&rdquo; She sat up again and fluffed the pillow
behind her. &ldquo;But the senator might object, Longinus. He&rsquo;s a proud
man, proud of his name, his lineage. He&rsquo;s not going to like the
idea of his son&rsquo;s marrying a bastard and a divorcee, even though
she may be the granddaughter of the Emperor Augustus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t object, Claudia; I&rsquo;m sure of it. But even if he should,
I&rsquo;d marry you anyway, despite him, despite Sejanus, despite even
old Tiberius himself.&rdquo; He adjusted his tunic, then came over to
stand by the bed. &ldquo;Remember that, Claudia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even in spite of last night?&rdquo; She was smiling up at him, and
she said it capriciously, but he thought he detected a note of seriousness
in her voice. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m terribly wanton, Longinus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night makes me all the more determined.&rdquo; He studied
her for a long moment; her expression was coy, but radiant too,
a little wistful and warmly affectionate, he saw. &ldquo;Wanton? Of
course not, my dear.&rdquo; A mischievous grin slowly crossed his face.
&ldquo;Wanting, maybe. And wanted certainly, wanted by me. The most
desirable woman I&rsquo;ve ever known, the most wanted.&rdquo; He bent
down to her, his eyes aflame, and gently he pushed the outthrust
chin to separate slightly the rouge-smudged lips raised hungrily to
his. Greedily their lips met and held, and then as the girl lifted
a hand to the back of his head to crush his face against hers, he
grasped the protecting sheet from her fingers and flung it toward
the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you beast!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;By all the silly little gods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roaring, he darted for the peristylium. As he fled past the long
mirror near the doorway, he caught in it a glimpse of the laughing
Claudia struggling wildly to cover herself with the twisted sheet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c4">4</h2>
<p>The magnificent villa of the Prefect Lucius Aelius Sejanus clung
precariously to the precipitous slope high above the blue waters of
the bay. The greater part of the mansion had been built some
hundred years before in the days of Lucius Licinius Lucullus by
one of the general&rsquo;s fellow patricians. This man&rsquo;s family had suffered
the misfortune of having had the villa confiscated after the
pater familias had been beheaded for making the wrong choice in
a civil war of that era.</p>
<p>Sejanus had acquired the property&mdash;many Romans wondered
how, but they were too discreet to inquire&mdash;and had added to it
extensively, including a spacious peristylium with a great fountain
that spouted water piped from higher on the slope and palms and
flowers and oriental plants. But most interesting of his improvements
was the spreading terrace pushed outward from the peristylium
to the very edge of the precipice, paved in ornate mosaic
with slabs of marble transported in government barges from quarries
far distant&mdash;gray and red from Egypt, yellow in various shades
and black from Numidia, green cipolin from Euboea&mdash;and bordered
by a protecting balustrade of white Carrara.</p>
<p>This morning the Prefect and his guest, Pontius Pilate, a cohort
commander lately returned from a campaign in Germania, sat on
this terrace before a round bronze table whose legs were molded in
the size and likeness of a lion&rsquo;s foreleg. On the table were a pitcher
and matching goblets. Pilate, large, broad-framed, with a round
head and hair closely cropped, a heavy man and, in his early forties,
perhaps a score of years younger than the Prefect, was eying the
unusual pitcher. Sejanus motioned to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be interested in glassware,&rdquo; he said, as he reached over
and with a fingernail tapped one of the delicate blue, blown goblets.
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
&ldquo;These pieces came from Phoenicia. No doubt you will have
the opportunity while you&rsquo;re in Judaea to visit the glassworks
where they were blown. It&rsquo;s situated near Tyre, up the coast from
Caesarea and not far from Mount Carmel. One of Senator Piso&rsquo;s
enterprises.&rdquo; He fastened his unblinking small eyes on Pilate&rsquo;s
florid face. &ldquo;But of course you won&rsquo;t be concerned with this operation.
It&rsquo;s not in Judaea anyway, and its affairs&mdash;so far as Rome is
concerned&mdash;are being supervised from Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate nodded. &ldquo;I understand, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. It&rsquo;s important that you do understand fully. There
should be no area, for example, in which your duties and responsibilities
overlap those of Tetrarch Herod Antipas. I trust that you&rsquo;ll
always bear that in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can depend upon my doing so, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then is there anything else not entirely clear to you concerning
your duties, powers, and functions as I&rsquo;ve outlined them? Do
you fully understand that as Procurator you will be required to
keep the Jews in your province as quiet and contented as possible&mdash;and
they are a cantankerous, fanatical, troublesome race, I warn
you&mdash;even though you will be draining them of their revenues to
the limit of their capacities?&rdquo; He held up an admonishing forefinger.
&ldquo;And do you also understand that it is tremendously important
for you, as Procurator of Judaea, to avoid becoming embroiled
in any of the turmoils arising out of their foolish but
zealously defended one-god system of religion?&rdquo; Sejanus curled his
lower lip to cover the upper and slowly pushed them both out
into a rounded tight pucker; his eyes remained firmly fixed on the
cohort commander&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;It is a difficult post, being Procurator
in Judaea, Pilate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a difficult assignment, sir, but it&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;ve been hoping
to obtain, and I appreciate the appointment. I understand
what is required, and I shall make every effort to administer Judaea
to the best of my ability and in accordance with your instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you may consider yourself Procurator, Pilate. When the
Emperor gives you your audience tomorrow, he will approve what
I have actually already done.&rdquo; A sly smile overspread the Prefect&rsquo;s
weasel face. &ldquo;But there is one thing further that you must agree
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
to do, Pilate, if you wish to become Procurator of Judaea.&rdquo; He
stood, and Pilate arose, remaining stiffly erect. Sejanus walked to
the marble balustrade and looked down at the blue water far below.
&ldquo;But first, come here. I want to show you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cohort commander strode quickly to the Prefect&rsquo;s side.
Sejanus pointed toward the north. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Misenum
there, and just beyond is Baiae. Over there&rdquo;&mdash;he swept his arm in
an arc&mdash;&ldquo;is Puteoli. And in this half-moon of shore line fronting
on the bay between here and Puteoli&rsquo;s harbor, in those mansions
scrambling up the slopes&rdquo;&mdash;he drew a half circle in the air that
ended with his forefinger pointing straight south&mdash;&ldquo;in this lower
district of Campania from here to Puteoli and Neapolis and around
the rugged rim of the gulf, past Vesuvius and Herculaneum, Pompeii
and Surrentum out to the end of Capri is embraced the very
cream of the Empire&rsquo;s aristocracy and wealth.&rdquo; He turned to face
north again. &ldquo;There. That is the villa for which Lucullus paid ten
million sesterces. You can see parts of the roof among the trees
and flowering plants. They say that some of the cherry trees he
introduced from Pontus are still bearing. Yes, they rightly call this
the playground of the Empire. Look down there,&rdquo; he said, pointing
toward the gaily colored barges idling along the shore between
Baiae and Puteoli. &ldquo;There you will find beautiful women, Pilate,
gorgeous creatures who are completely uninhibited, delightfully
immoral. Beautiful Baiae, where husbands able to afford it can
find happy respite from monogamy. Ah, Ovid, how you would
sing of Baiae today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently for a moment now the Prefect contemplated the villa-filled
slopes, the pleasure barges, the lazily lifting sulphurous
fumes above Lake Avernus in the crater of an extinct volcano to
the north, and the sleeping cone of Vesuvius looming magnificently
in the west. Then he turned again to face Pilate, and a sly,
malevolent smile crossed his narrow face. &ldquo;You, too, Commander,
some day can live in luxury out there on the slope above Baiae ...
if you manage affairs in Judaea properly,&rdquo; he paused, for emphasis,
&ldquo;by following explicitly the instructions you have received and will
continue to receive from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ambitious, sir,&rdquo; Pilate answered, &ldquo;and I would take great
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
pleasure some day in joining the equestrian class here. But whether
I am able to achieve a villa at Baiae or not, I am determined to
follow explicitly the Prefect&rsquo;s instructions and desires.&rdquo; His hand
on the marble balustrade, Pilate studied the movement in the bay.
Then he faced the Prefect. &ldquo;But you said a moment ago, sir, that
there was still one more provision?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Pilate.&rdquo; Sejanus pointed to the chairs beside the lion-legged
table. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s sit down and have some more of the
Falernian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they took their seats, a slave who all the while had been
hovering attentively near-by came forward quickly and filled the
goblets. Sejanus sipped slowly. &ldquo;Surely you have guessed that the
Emperor and I confer at times on matters of particular intimacy,
such as the problems of his household, even the affairs of members
of his own Imperial family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see, sir, how the Emperor would wish the Prefect&rsquo;s counsel
in matters of every kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo; Sejanus toyed with the wine glass, then abruptly
set it down. &ldquo;This is the provision, Pilate, and I think it not unreasonable.
In fact, I might explain that it was at my suggestion
that Tiberius has included it. And were I in your position, Pilate&rdquo;&mdash;his
eyes brightened, and he flattened his lips against his teeth&mdash;&ldquo;I
would be delighted that such a provision had been made. She
is a beautiful woman, young, possessed of every feminine appeal,
and a woman to be earnestly desired and sought, at least in the
opinion of one old man who&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;can still look, appreciate,
and imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Pilate. The Emperor expects you to marry his stepdaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claudia!&rdquo; Pilate said in amazement. &ldquo;The granddaughter of
Augustus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Sejanus was eying him intently. &ldquo;And of Antony,
too, and Cleopatra, I&rsquo;ve always understood.&rdquo; A sly smile again
crossed his face. &ldquo;And, if I&rsquo;m a capable judge, a woman possessed
of everything Cleopatra had.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Pilate seemed oblivious to the Prefect&rsquo;s description. &ldquo;But why
should he want me, the son of a Spanish...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will be Procurator of Judaea,&rdquo; Sejanus interrupted.
&ldquo;Look, Pilate,&rdquo; he went on, his face all seriousness now, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
you&rsquo;ve heard the story of Claudia&rsquo;s mother, the wife of Tiberius.
Augustus was forced to banish her when her adulteries became
notorious. It&rsquo;s one of those paradoxes, Pilate, of Imperial life. The
Emperor may indulge in any of the ordinarily forbidden delights,
adultery, pederasty&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled again, but this time his smile was
a scarcely concealed sneer&mdash;&ldquo;but his stepdaughter may not. Or she
may not publicly, at any rate. And now that Claudia is divorced
from Aemilius and has no husband to point to in the event
that....&rdquo; He paused and laid his hand on Pilate&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I dislike
putting the matter so bluntly, Pilate, but there is no other way
to explain the situation. The Emperor wishes to forestall any scandal.
The best way to do so, he thinks, is to have his stepdaughter
married and sent as far away as possible from Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, doesn&rsquo;t custom forbid the wives of generals and legates
and procurators from journeying with them to their provincial
posts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Custom, yes. But custom is not always followed. Agrippina, for
example, accompanied Germanicus on his campaign in the north.
Caligula was born while she was away with the general.&rdquo; He was
watching Pilate closely. &ldquo;But you have not said whether you
accept the Emperor&rsquo;s final provision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I would be greatly honored and highly pleased to be the
husband of the granddaughter of the great Augustus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sejanus beamed. &ldquo;Then, Pilate, you may consider yourself the
Procurator of Judaea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prefect held up his hand to interrupt. &ldquo;The Emperor will
speak to you about the necessity of your keeping your wife under
firm authority. But I would like to emphasize something more important,
Commander, and that is this: keep her happy, and keep
her satisfied, in Judaea. I want no reports coming to me that the
Emperor&rsquo;s stepdaughter is being kept virtually a prisoner, that she
is suffering banishment from Rome.&rdquo; His eyes flamed again, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
he licked his sensuous lips. &ldquo;Do you understand, Pilate? Claudia
is a modern woman. She&rsquo;s accustomed to the ways of Rome&rsquo;s
equestrians. Keep her contented, Pilate; do nothing to add to her
burden of living in a land that to her, no doubt, will be dull and
even loathsome. If sometimes she strays into indiscretions, overlook
them. Don&rsquo;t attempt to make of her a Caesar&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo; His
stern expression relaxed into a grin. &ldquo;Besides, I believe it&rsquo;s too late
for anyone to accomplish that.&rdquo; Then as quickly as it had come,
the levity was gone. &ldquo;But I interrupted you. You were going to ask
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Pilate stared thoughtfully at his hands. &ldquo;I was wondering,
sir, if Claudia has been apprised of the Emperor&rsquo;s and your
wishes. What has she to say about all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say?&rdquo; Sejanus smiled and rubbed his palms together. &ldquo;My
dear Procurator, Claudia has nothing to say in matters such as this.
Tiberius speaks for his stepdaughter. And <i>I</i> speak for Tiberius.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c5">5</h2>
<p>The next morning one of the fastest triremes of the Roman navy
carried the Prefect Sejanus and Pontius Pilate from the harbor
below the Prefect&rsquo;s villa straight southward across the gulf toward
the island of Capri.</p>
<p>When Sejanus finished discussing certain other matters of business
with the Emperor, he had his aide summon Pilate into the
Imperial chamber. The cohort commander was nervous as he entered
the great hall. It was his first sight of Tiberius since the
Emperor had allowed his crafty minister to bring all nine of the
Praetorian Guard&rsquo;s cohorts into the camp near the Viminal Gate,
from which, on a moment&rsquo;s notice, they could sally forth to enforce
the Prefect&rsquo;s will, even to giving orders to the Senate itself.
A year ago the Emperor, melancholy, embittered, tired of rule, had
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
left Rome and journeyed southward to Capri to seek on that island
the privacy he had long craved. Since then, with the exception of
the wily Prefect and a few others&mdash;the Emperor&rsquo;s young girls and,
according to Roman gossip, his powdered, painted, and perfumed
young boys and the growing circle of poets and philosophers&mdash;Tiberius
Claudius Nero Caesar had seen few visitors. Gradually he
had relinquished affairs of state to the scheming Prefect Sejanus.</p>
<p>But now Pilate saw confronting him a man vastly changed from
the tall, powerful, and thoroughly able general he had known earlier.
The Emperor was noticeably stooped; his once broad forehead
and now almost naked pate seemed to have shriveled into a narrowing
expanse of wrinkled skull. Acne had inflamed and pocked
his face, and the skin lay in folds around the stem of his neck
like that of a vulture&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tiberius greeted Pilate perfunctorily. &ldquo;The Prefect tells me
you&rsquo;re petitioning us for appointment to the post of Procurator in
Judaea. Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire, if it is the will of the Emperor that I serve in that capacity,
I shall be happy to undertake the assignment and serve the
Emperor and the Empire to the full extent of my ability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I would expect and demand,&rdquo; Tiberius harshly replied.
&ldquo;It is a difficult post. The Jews are a stubborn and intractable
people. They are fanatically religious, and they resent bitterly and
will oppose even to the sacrifice of their lives all actions they consider
offensive to their strange one-god religion. Their priests are
diabolically clever, and they are determined to rule the people in
accordance with the ancient religious laws and traditions of the
land.&rdquo; His cold eyes fastened upon the cohort commander&rsquo;s countenance.
&ldquo;Pilate, I shall expect you to govern in that province.
Foremost among your functions of office, in addition to maintaining
at all times Roman law and order, will be the levying and
collecting of ample taxes. That, in itself, will be a burdensome
duty. In addition, I charge you to see to it that Rome is not embroiled
in any great difficulty with these Jews. I warn you, it will
be difficult. Do you think you are equal to such a task?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am bold enough, Sire, to think so. Certainly I shall do everything
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
within my power to demonstrate to the Emperor and his
Prefect that I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see.&rdquo; The Emperor&rsquo;s cold eyes bored into those of
the officer standing before him. Suddenly his grimness relaxed into
a thin smile. &ldquo;Sejanus tells me also that you have ambitions to
marry my stepdaughter Claudia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To marry your stepdaughter, Sire, should it be the Emperor&rsquo;s
will, would bestow on me the highest honor and afford me the
greatest happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently he knows little about her,&rdquo; Tiberius observed wryly
to Sejanus, &ldquo;else he would not consider himself so fortunate.&rdquo; But
quickly his eyes were on Pilate again, and the malevolent smile
was gone. &ldquo;I grant my permission, Pilate. The dowry will be arranged,
and I assure you it will be adequate. Sejanus will settle the
details. Unfortunately I shall not be able to attend the festivities
of the wedding.&rdquo; Now he twisted his head to face the Prefect. &ldquo;If
there is nothing further, Sejanus?&rdquo; He did not wait for an answer
but arose. The Prefect and Pontius Pilate, bowing, were backing
toward the doorway when Tiberius suddenly stopped them. &ldquo;Wait.
I wish to tell Pilate a story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once a traveler stopped to aid a man lying wounded beside the
road,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;He started to brush away the flies clustered
about the wound, when the injured man spoke out. &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t
drive away the flies,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;They have fed on me until now
they are satisfied and no longer hurt me. But if you brush these
off, then other, more hungry ones will come and feed on me until
I am sucked dry of blood.&rsquo;&rdquo; A mirthless smile crinkled the corners
of his mouth. &ldquo;Pilate, I want no new thirsty fly settling after
Valerius Gratus upon the Jews in Judaea. Nevertheless, from them
I must be sent a sufficiency of blood. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate swallowed. &ldquo;Sire, I understand.&rdquo; He licked his heavy red
lips.</p>
<p>As they were at the door, Tiberius raised his hand to stop them
again. A sly grin, leering and sadistic, spread across his face. &ldquo;Take
Claudia with you to Judaea, Procurator. And rule her, man! Rule
her!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c6">6</h2>
<p>Languidly the Princess Herodias of the Maccabean branch of the
Herod dynasty lay back in the warm, scented water so that only
her head, framed in black hair held dry by a finely woven silk net,
was exposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More hot water, Neaera,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;But be careful. I
don&rsquo;t want to look cooked for the Tetrarch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly the slave maid turned the tap, and steaming water
gushed from the ornate eagle&rsquo;s-head faucet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; shouted Herodias after a minute. &ldquo;By the
gods, shut it off!&rdquo; She sat upright in the tiled tub, and the water
ran down from her neck and shoulders, leaving little islands of
suds clinging to her glistening white body. &ldquo;Now hand me the
mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She extended a dripping arm and accepted the polished bronze.
For a long moment she studied her image. &ldquo;Neaera, tell me truthfully,
am I showing my age too dreadfully?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mistress, you are not old,&rdquo; the maid protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a flatterer, Neaera. Salome, remember, is fourteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were married very young, Mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was married a long time ago, too.&rdquo; She peered again
into the mirror. &ldquo;Look. Already I can see tiny crow&rsquo;s-foot lines
around my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But unguents and a little eye shadowing....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More flattery.&rdquo; Herodias shook a wet finger at the young woman&rsquo;s
nose. &ldquo;But I love it; so don&rsquo;t ever stop. But now&rdquo;&mdash;she grasped
the sides of the tub&mdash;&ldquo;help me out. I mustn&rsquo;t lie in this hot water
any longer, or I&rsquo;ll be as pink as a roast by the time the Tetrarch
comes.&rdquo; She grasped the maid&rsquo;s arm to steady herself as she stepped
from the tub to the tufted mat, and Neaera began to rub her
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
down with a heavy towel. When the slave maid had finished drying
her, Herodias turned to face the full-length minor, her body
flushed and glowing from the brisk robbing. Palms on hips, she
studied her own straight, still lithe frame. &ldquo;Really, Neaera,&rdquo; she
asked, &ldquo;how do I look?&rdquo; With fingers spread she caressed the
gently rounded smooth plane of her stomach and then lifted
cupped palms to her firm, finely shaped breasts. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t lost my
figure too badly, have I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t lost it at all, Mistress,&rdquo; the maid assured her, as
she picked up a filmy undergarment from the bench. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still
youthful and still beautiful.&rdquo; Herodias braced herself as the girl
bent low to assist her into the black silk garment. Neaera leaned
back and studied the older woman again. &ldquo;You have the figure of
a young woman, indeed, Mistress,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though fully matured
and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what, Neaera? What were you going to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mistress, a figure to me more beautiful because of maturity,
and more interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And more alluring, more seductive, maybe?&rdquo; Her smile was
lightly wanton. &ldquo;To the Tetrarch, perhaps? But the Herods,
Neaera, and old Tiberius, too, I hear, like their women very
young.&rdquo; Her expression sobered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost afraid he&rsquo;ll be having
eyes for Salome rather than for me. The child has matured
remarkably, you know, in the last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think, though, Mistress, that the Tetrarch....&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp knocking on the door interrupted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the gods, Neaera, it must be the Tetrarch, and I&rsquo;m not
ready. Tell Strabo to seat him in the peristylium and pour him
wine and say that I shall be ready soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the visitor was not the Tetrarch of Galilee. Strabo announced
that the Emperor&rsquo;s stepdaughter was in the atrium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claudia! How wonderful! Show her into the solarium, and tell
her I&rsquo;ll join her in a minute. Neaera, hurry and fetch me my robe.
We can sit and talk while you do my hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay for more than a few minutes,&rdquo; the Emperor&rsquo;s stepdaughter
announced when, a moment later, Herodias greeted her
in the solarium. &ldquo;Longinus is going to take me out to the chariot
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
races, and he may be waiting for me right now. But I wanted to
tell you, Herodias....&rdquo; She paused, her expression suddenly
questioning. &ldquo;Bona Dea, I&rsquo;ll bet that the Tetrarch is taking you
there, too, and I&rsquo;ve caught you in the middle of getting dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right, but there&rsquo;s no hurry, Claudia. I can finish
quickly. And if I&rsquo;m not ready when he comes, he can wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Claudia laughed, &ldquo;you already have the Tetrarch so entranced
that he will wait patiently while you dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not patiently, perhaps, but he&rsquo;ll wait ... without protesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it won&rsquo;t be long before you&rsquo;ll be marrying him and leaving
for Palestine.&rdquo; She said it teasingly, but immediately her expression
changed to reveal concern. &ldquo;But, Herodias, when you do,
what will his present wife say; how will she take it? And his subjects
in Galilee? Doesn&rsquo;t the Jewish religion forbid a man&rsquo;s having
more than one living wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The daughter of King Aretas will resent his bringing another
wife to Tiberias, no doubt&rdquo;&mdash;Herodias smiled coyly&mdash;&ldquo;if I do marry
him. And as for the religion of the Jews, well, my dear, you must
know that neither Antipas nor I follow its tenets too closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of you or the Tetrarch as
much as I was of how his present wife would react. And the
people of Galilee, too, how will they feel about his having two living
wives, one of whom is his niece. Won&rsquo;t it offend them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we marry, it will offend a great many of them. But my
grandfather, old King Herod, father of Philip and Antipas, had
ten wives, remember, nine of them at the same time. The Jews
didn&rsquo;t like that, but what could they do? No, we aren&rsquo;t too concerned
about what the Jews will think. But Aretas&rsquo; daughter probably
will try to cause trouble. Not because Antipas will be having
a new bedfellow, but because she won&rsquo;t any longer be Tetrarchess.
Being replaced will make her furious. She cares not a fig for the
Tetrarch&rsquo;s bedding with other women; she even gave him a harem
of Arabian women, Antipas told me.&rdquo; She paused, smiling. &ldquo;Claudia,
you remember that black-haired woman at the banquet the
other night, the one called Mary of Magdala?&rdquo; Claudia nodded.
&ldquo;Well, Antipas told me that his wife not only knew that Mary
was coming with him to Rome but actually suggested that he bring
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
her. He said his wife and Mary were good friends even though
the Tetrarchess knew quite well what the relationship was between
him and Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the Tetrarchess sent this Mary with Antipas to keep
his eyes from straying to other women, like you, for example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeping his eyes from straying would be an impossible task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Mary is jealous of you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman!&rdquo; Herodias tossed her head. &ldquo;Of course not. Nor
am I jealous of her. I really don&rsquo;t care if he spends an occasional
night in her bed. All I want is to be Tetrarchess. If he marries me,
I shall insist, though, that he divorce that Arabian woman. No,
our concern, Claudia&rdquo;&mdash;she lowered her voice and glanced cautiously
around the room, but Neaera had left the solarium&mdash;&ldquo;is not
what the Jews in Galilee, or his present wife, or this woman from
Magdala will think, but rather what the Prefect himself will think.
Sejanus could cause us much trouble. But now everything seems
to be all right. Antipas assures me that we needn&rsquo;t worry about it
any longer. He says that he and Sejanus have reached an understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have a good idea of what that understanding is based
upon,&rdquo; Claudia said. &ldquo;But what about your husband, Herodias?
What will Philip think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip! Hah!&rdquo; She sneered. &ldquo;What Philip thinks is of no concern.
I&rsquo;ve never really cared for him anyway. It&rsquo;s a little hard to
feel romantic toward a man who&rsquo;s your half uncle, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Antipas, too, is your half uncle, isn&rsquo;t he? And he&rsquo;s
Philip&rsquo;s half brother as well. Hmm.&rdquo; She smiled mischievously.
&ldquo;That makes him both Salome&rsquo;s half uncle and half great-uncle,
doesn&rsquo;t it? That is, if Philip&rsquo;s her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; Herodias admitted. &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s her father. Anyway,
he thinks so. But he&rsquo;s also an old man, a generation older
than I.&rdquo; She said it with evident sarcasm. &ldquo;Antipas is old too, of
course, but remember, my dear, he&rsquo;s the Tetrarch of Galilee,
while Philip is only a tiresome, fast aging, disowned son of a dead
king, dependent for his very existence on the favor of a crotchety
Emperor and a conniving Prefect. Antipas is old and fat, Claudia,
but he has power and an opulence far in excess of Philip&rsquo;s, and a
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
title, too. And some day, perhaps not too far away, with my pushing
him, who knows, he may be a king like his father was.&rdquo; She
shrugged. &ldquo;As for romance, the world&rsquo;s filled with younger men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia studied the face of her Idumaean friend. &ldquo;Herodias, you
worship power, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Herodias replied tartly. &ldquo;Power and wealth,
you forget, are rightfully mine. I am the granddaughter of Mariamne,
King Herod&rsquo;s royal wife, daughter of the Maccabeans, while
Philip&rsquo;s mother was only a high priest&rsquo;s daughter and the mother
of Antipas was a Samaritan woman. I am descended from the true
royalty in Israel.&rdquo; Her irritation faded as quickly as it had come.
&ldquo;You say I worship power. What else, pray, is there for one to
worship? Your pale, anemic Roman gods? Bah! You don&rsquo;t worship
them yourself. Why then should I? I&rsquo;m not even a Roman. Silly
superstition, your Roman gods, and well you know it, Claudia.
And the gods of the Greeks are no better. Nor the Egyptians. If
I had to embrace the superstition of any religion I would be inclined
to worship the Yahweh of the Jews. He&rsquo;s the only god who
makes any sense at all to me, but even he is too fire-breathing and
vindictive for my liking. But I&rsquo;m not a Jew, Claudia, even though
I am descended on one side from the royal Maccabeans. I&rsquo;m a
Herod, and the Herods are Idumaeans. The Jews call them pagans,
and by the Jews&rsquo; standards, pagans we are.&rdquo; For a moment she was
thoughtful, and Claudia said nothing to break the silence. &ldquo;But I
suppose you&rsquo;re right, Claudia,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;If I have any god
at all, he&rsquo;s the two-headed god of power and money. And if the
Tetrarch were your Longinus, well, my god would have a third
head, pleasure. I envy you, Claudia! By the way,&rdquo; she added, as she
poured wine for her guest and herself, &ldquo;may I be so bold, my
dear, as to inquire how things between you and the centurion stand
just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I came to see you, Herodias. I wanted to thank
you for a most enjoyable evening too, but mainly I wanted to
tell you that Longinus and I have&mdash;how did you express it&mdash;reached
an understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Herodias beamed. &ldquo;Are you going to marry him,
Claudia, or are you...?&rdquo; She hesitated, grinning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Am I going to marry him, or will we just continue as we are
without the formality of marriage vows?&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m
planning to marry him. But this is what I wanted to tell you,
Herodias. I&rsquo;m going out with him to Palestine. He&rsquo;s being sent
there on some sort of special mission by the Prefect Sejanus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the gods, that is wonderful, Claudia! Then we&rsquo;ll be able
to see each other out there. Where will you be stationed? At
Caesarea? Jerusalem? Maybe even Tiberias?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t received his detailed orders yet. But I&rsquo;ll be able to
visit you at the palace anyway. I hear it&rsquo;s a magnificent place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be. I&rsquo;m anxious to see it myself; you know, I haven&rsquo;t
been near the place since it was finished. And it will be wonderful
to have you and Longinus to visit us.&rdquo; But suddenly her expression
sobered. &ldquo;Claudia, has the Emperor given his permission for
you to marry Longinus? And does the Prefect approve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither of them knows about it yet. But I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll both
be glad to see me married and away from Rome. Longinus is going
to speak to Sejanus about us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard voices in the atrium. Claudia stood up quickly.
&ldquo;That must be the Tetrarch. By Bona Dea, I didn&rsquo;t realize I was
staying this long; I must be going. Longinus will be waiting for
me. Herodias, surely we&rsquo;ll see one another again before either of us
sails for Palestine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must. And when we do, we&rsquo;ll both know more about
our plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neaera entered. &ldquo;Has the Tetrarch come?&rdquo; Herodias asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mistress, it&rsquo;s a soldier sent by the Prefect. He seeks the
Lady Claudia. He awaits her in the atrium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier, one of the Praetorian Guardsmen, announced that
the Prefect Sejanus was at that moment waiting for Claudia in
her own apartment at the Imperial Palace. He added that he
hoped they might start immediately; he feared the Prefect might
be getting impatient.</p>
<p>But when they reached her house and she entered the atrium
to greet the Prefect of the Praetorian Guard, Sejanus bowed low
and smiled reassuringly. &ldquo;I come from an audience with your beloved
stepfather, the Emperor, at Capri,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He commanded
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
me to bear to you his esteem and fatherly love and to offer his
congratulations upon the most excellent plans he has projected&mdash;with
my warm approval, let me hasten to assure you&mdash;for your
forthcoming marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my marriage? But, Prefect Sejanus....&rdquo; Claudia paused,
striving to maintain outward composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it comes as quite a surprise to you. But the arrangements
have been completed, and I&rsquo;ve come here to tell you immediately
on my return from Capri. You and your future husband are
the only ones who are being informed now of the Emperor&rsquo;s plans.
But you will be married soon, even before you and your husband
leave for his tour of duty in Palestine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Palestine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How could the Emperor have known about Longinus and me?
The Prefect? Of course, that&rsquo;s how. Sejanus knew that Longinus
was with me at the banquet Antipas gave for Herodias; he knew
that Longinus was at my house later that evening when he sent
Cornelius out to fetch him, or he learned of it when they came
afterward to his palace. Old Sejanus must not be so bad, after all.
Nor is the Emperor, either. Perhaps I have been too severe in
judging them. Perhaps they both have their good moments, their
generous impulses....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to Palestine.&rdquo; The Prefect was speaking. &ldquo;He has promised
your hand in marriage to a Roman army officer who, if he follows
my orders implicitly and remains completely loyal to me, may
shortly be not only a man of wealth but also a leader of influence
in the affairs of the Empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia was about to express her thanks to the Emperor and his
most excellent Prefect and to ask when the wedding would be
held. But some instinctive vein of caution restrained her from
mentioning Longinus&rsquo; name. Now the Prefect was speaking again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needless to say, I join the Emperor in praying the gods that
you and the Procurator Pontius Pilate lead long lives and find great
happiness with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Procurator Pontius Pilate! Then....&rdquo; But again caution
stopped her just in time.</p>
<p>Sejanus smiled. &ldquo;You are surprised, my dear Claudia? And
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
whom did you think the Emperor had chosen to be your husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I ... I don&rsquo;t even know this Pontius Pilate.&rdquo; Claudia ignored
the Prefect&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;He is to be Procurator in Palestine,
succeeding Valerius Gratus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Procurator of Judaea, with headquarters at Caesarea, yes.&rdquo; His
grin was sardonically beguiling. &ldquo;But what were you about to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to observe that then I would be spending the rest
of my life away from Rome, living in a distant provincial army
post,&rdquo; she lied, not too convincingly, she suspected.</p>
<p>But Sejanus did not pursue his questioning. &ldquo;Not if the Procurator
conducts the affairs of his post in the manner that I have
outlined to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he been informed of the Emperor&rsquo;s plans for ... for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And he is tremendously happy and excited, as what man
wouldn&rsquo;t be, my dear Claudia?&rdquo; His lips flattened bloodless across
his teeth, and his little eyes flamed. &ldquo;Even I, with my youth long
fled, envy him!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c7">7</h2>
<p>Claudia, striving to be courteously casual, walked with the Prefect
to the doorway where two Praetorian Guardsmen awaited him. As
they went out she closed the pivoted double doors behind them,
but after a moment she cautiously drew one back and peered
through the narrow slit.</p>
<p>The Prefect&rsquo;s bearers and the guards who had remained outside
were standing stiffly at attention, the bearers at the sedan-chair
handles; one of the guards stepped forward quickly to open the
door. Sejanus paused an instant and spoke to the man; then he
stepped into the chair and, as the guard closed the door, pulled
together the shielding curtains. The guard raised his hand, and the
bearers moved off smartly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Claudia saw, however, that the bodyguard did not march off
with the Prefect&rsquo;s procession; instead, he peered about furtively,
cast a hurried glance toward her doorway, and then merged into
the traffic pushing along the narrow, cobbled way. Momentarily
she lost him but in the next instant discovered him idling in front
of a shop diagonally across from her entrance. But not for long did
he study the wares of the merchant; she saw that he had faced
about and was staring intently at her own doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; she observed to Tullia, who had retreated into
the shadowed narrow corridor as Sejanus was leaving. &ldquo;The Prefect
left one of his bodyguards to watch the house. He either wishes to
know where I&rsquo;ll be going or who will be coming here, perhaps
both. I don&rsquo;t know what he is scheming, Tullia&rdquo;&mdash;the maid had
come forward and secured the doors&mdash;&ldquo;but whatever it is, I don&rsquo;t
like it. Longinus may endanger himself by coming. We must warn
him. But how, Tullia? He is likely to be arriving any moment; he
must have been delayed at Castra Praetoria, or he would have been
here already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly she told the maid the startling news the Prefect had
brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone who leaves this house through these doors, Mistress,
then is sure to be followed. But I could go out through the servant&rsquo;s
entrance on some contrived mission and perhaps be able to
warn him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, Tullia. You can be taking something to Senator Piso&rsquo;s
house and carry a message to Longinus. Talk with him if he is
there and tell him what has happened, but say that I&rsquo;ll arrange to
meet him later, perhaps at the house of Herodias.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or maybe, Mistress, at the shop of Stephanos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Maybe the goldsmith&rsquo;s would be better. But if the Prefect&rsquo;s
men should follow and ask you questions, Tullia, what will
you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could be bearing a small gift to Philo, Senator Piso&rsquo;s old
Greek slave who tutored his children. He&rsquo;s quite ill and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful! Tullia, you are indeed my treasure. Take the old
man a jar of that honey from Samos; he would like that. And some
wheat cakes and a bottle of the Falernian.&rdquo; She was silent a moment,
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
thoughtful. &ldquo;By the Bountiful Mother! Tullia, I&rsquo;ll help you
get away by leading that soldier myself on a false chase. Fetch me
my cloak and scarf. I&rsquo;ll pretend to be disguising myself in order
to slip away. Then he&rsquo;ll follow me. Now find the things to take
to old Philo, and get yourself ready. And do hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes Tullia returned with the cloak and scarf. &ldquo;The
basket of food is ready,&rdquo; she said. She helped her mistress put on
the cloak and tie the scarf so that much of her face was concealed.
&ldquo;Leave the door ajar as I go out,&rdquo; Claudia instructed her, &ldquo;and
when you see the soldier following me, close the door and slip
away yourself through the servants&rsquo; entrance. And return the same
way, as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Tullia, say to Longinus that I instructed you to tell him
that what has happened changes nothing, that as far as I am concerned
everything is just as it was with him and me. But say as
little as you can to anyone else, Tullia, and nothing concerning
the Prefect&rsquo;s visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia walked to the entrance doors and turned to face her
maid again. &ldquo;You go out and look around furtively as though you
were seeing that the way was clear for me. That will likely warn
the guardsman that something is afoot, that we suspect someone
may be watching the house. Then I&rsquo;ll go out, and because I will
not have my bearers summoned, he&rsquo;ll surmise that I am trying to
leave unnoticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she puckered her rouged lips into a thoughtful bud. &ldquo;But
why is old Sejanus having us watched? Did he think that I would
slip out to tell Longinus? Does he want me to tell the centurion
and perhaps deliberately prejudice him against Pilate?&rdquo; She shook
her head slowly. &ldquo;But how can he know about Longinus and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Mistress, he only suspects,&rdquo; Tullia answered. &ldquo;It may
be that he is trying to find out just what your relationship is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so. But little he&rsquo;ll discover now, by the gods!&rdquo; She
opened the door and peered out. &ldquo;Now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tullia slipped through the doorway, looked up and down the
narrow street, then stepped back into the atrium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Claudia said. &ldquo;Be careful, Tullia. And do guard
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
your tongue.&rdquo; Outside she readjusted her scarf and pulled her
cloak more closely about her. Then she stepped into the cobble-stoned
way and walked rapidly along it.</p>
<p>Tullia, peeping through the slit in the doorway, saw the Prefect&rsquo;s
man emerge from the shadows of a shop entrance and move off
quickly to follow her. When the two had disappeared around the
turn, Tullia closed the doors and hurriedly recrossed the atrium. A
moment later she slipped out through the servants&rsquo; entrance. A
freshly starched napkin covered the food in the basket she carried.</p>
<h2 id="c8">8</h2>
<p>An unexpected assignment, fortunately, had delayed Longinus&rsquo; departure
from Castra Praetoria, and he had just reached home when
Tullia arrived at Senator Piso&rsquo;s. Quickly she told him of the Prefect&rsquo;s
visit to her mistress.</p>
<p>He listened attentively, outwardly calm but inwardly with rage
mounting as her story progressed. &ldquo;Go back to your mistress, Tullia,&rdquo;
he said, when she finished, &ldquo;and tell her that with me, too,
nothing is changed. But warn her to make no attempt, until I tell
her, to communicate with me. The Prefect is diabolically clever; he
may suspect that we will try to thwart his plans. I don&rsquo;t understand
just what he&rsquo;s scheming; we must be careful. But assure her
that I will find some way of getting a message to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Centurion Longinus, if I may suggest, sir, should you send the
message, or bear it yourself, to the shop of Stephanos in the Vicus
Margaritarius....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that shop, Tullia, and the goldsmith, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, from there I could take your message verbally to my
mistress. Stephanos is the son of my father&rsquo;s brother. He can be
trusted, you may be assured, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good arrangement, Tullia. And should your mistress
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
wish to send me a message, you can leave it with the goldsmith.
But do warn her to be careful. The Prefect may be setting a trap
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goldsmith Stephanos was, like his cousin Tullia, a Greek-speaking
Jew who had been reared in the Jewish colony in Rome.
Although a young man, he had already established a profitable
business in the capital, and his customers numbered many of the
equestrian class, including members of Senator Piso&rsquo;s family. Consequently,
Longinus, were he being watched, could go to the goldsmith&rsquo;s
shop without arousing suspicion.</p>
<p>Longinus discovered how fortunate they had been in taking such
precautions when, a week after Tullia&rsquo;s visit to him, he was again
summoned to the palace of the Prefect.</p>
<p>Sejanus gave little time to the formalities of greeting the Senator&rsquo;s
son. &ldquo;I am now prepared to hand you your orders, Centurion
Longinus,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But before I do so I must ask you if you have
any reservations whatsoever concerning this mission I propose to
send you on.&rdquo; The Prefect&rsquo;s cold little eyes were studying him,
Longinus realized, and he was determined that he would reveal
neither fear nor surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, sir. I&rsquo;m a soldier, and I await the Prefect&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sejanus was not satisfied. &ldquo;When last I talked with you,
you said that you were hardly acquainted with Pontius Pilate, that
you were in no sense an intimate friend. But I ask you now, do
you have any hostility toward him?&rdquo; He leaned forward, and his
eyes bored into the centurion&rsquo;s bland countenance. &ldquo;Has anything
happened since then that would cause you to change your feeling
toward him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing that he has done, sir, that would cause me to
feel hostility toward him. Has he, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question seemed to surprise Sejanus. He leaned back against
his chair. &ldquo;He has done nothing. But something has been done
that may have caused you to feel bitter toward him.&rdquo; He was
studying the centurion intently. &ldquo;Bitterness toward the Procurator
would render you unfit for the assignment I am proposing for you,
just as close friendship for him would do the same.&rdquo; He smiled,
changing his stern tone to one of fatherly interest. &ldquo;Frankly, Longinus,
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
I had expected to find you bitter toward Pilate, the Emperor,
and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why, sir, should <i>I</i> be bitter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had thought that perhaps you would be jealous of him, resent
his....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jealous of Pilate?&rdquo; Boldly Longinus ventured to interrupt. &ldquo;But
why, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pilate is going to marry the Emperor&rsquo;s stepdaughter and take
her out to Judaea when he goes there to begin his duties as Procurator.
I had thought that you yourself might be planning to
marry Claudia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i>, sir?&rdquo; Longinus affected sudden surprise. &ldquo;May I respectfully
ask why you thought that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been seeing her since your return from Germania. She
accompanied you to the banquet Antipas gave for his brother&rsquo;s
wife.&rdquo; Sejanus shrugged. &ldquo;That suggested it to me.&rdquo; His lips thinned
into a feline grin. &ldquo;Since I made known to her the Emperor&rsquo;s
plans I have had you both watched; if you have met or communicated
with one another, it has escaped my men&rsquo;s sharp eyes.&rdquo; His
piggish eyes brightened. &ldquo;I want you to understand, Longinus, that
I am not the protector of either Claudia or Pilate. I am not the
least concerned with their private lives so long as what they do
doesn&rsquo;t harm me or the Empire. And let me add&rdquo;&mdash;his eyes were
dancing now&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not concerned with your private life either. I
am determined, however, that nothing be done to interfere with
our plans for Pilate and Claudia. But if after they are married and
gone out to Judaea, some evening in Caesarea or Jerusalem you
should find yourself in Pilate&rsquo;s bed when Pilate is away, that will
be no concern of mine, nor shall I care one green fig&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;
Suddenly the lascivious gleam was gone from his eyes, and his
countenance was grave. He raised a stern hand and leaned forward
again. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll require of you a true and unbiased report on
Pontius Pilate, Longinus. If you think you may be prejudiced
against the man because he will have taken Claudia away from
you, then I charge you to tell me now and I shall give you some
other assignment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you, sir, that I have no hostility toward him. But I do
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
wonder why Claudia is being required to marry him and be virtually
exiled from Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sejanus studied the senator&rsquo;s son a long moment. &ldquo;Longinus,
I shall be entirely frank with you, as I shall require you to be
with me,&rdquo; he replied, lowering his voice, though there were no
other ears to hear. &ldquo;The Emperor and I want Claudia exiled,
though we would never employ so harsh a word for her being sent
away from Rome. Claudia&rsquo;s the granddaughter of Augustus, remember,
and also&mdash;it&rsquo;s generally believed, at any rate&mdash;the granddaughter
of Mark Antony and the Egyptian Cleopatra. She&rsquo;s in
direct descent from strong-willed, able&mdash;and in their day tremendously
popular&mdash;forebears. Tiberius, on the other hand, is not.
Nor does he have any strong following. As you know, Longinus&rdquo;&mdash;he
paused, and his small black eyes for an instant weighed the
centurion&rsquo;s expression&mdash;&ldquo;in everything but name, I am the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir, but were Rome to overthrow the Emperor, the gods
forbid, would the people enthrone a woman? Surely, sir, they
would never....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. It&rsquo;s not likely, under any circumstances. But
you don&rsquo;t understand, Longinus.&rdquo; The Prefect&rsquo;s grim countenance
relaxed a bit, but he kept his voice low as he sat back against his
chair. &ldquo;Claudia is no longer married. While she was married to
that fop Aemilius there was no cause for concern. But now she&rsquo;s
divorced and in a position to marry again.&rdquo; He smiled, and the
wanton flame lighted once more. &ldquo;And beautiful. Gods, what a
figure!&rdquo; He rolled his eyes. &ldquo;If I were young again, with her I
could be Emperor of Rome!&rdquo; He was silent a moment. &ldquo;But I
am Emperor of Rome&mdash;in all but title.&rdquo; Now Sejanus was suddenly
grave, and old, and the flame was only of an innate cunning.
He leaned toward the centurion. &ldquo;Longinus, any man in Rome,
any man, would be happy to marry Claudia. She&rsquo;s beautiful, rich,
highly intelligent, and the granddaughter of Rome&rsquo;s greatest Emperor.
Being that, she remains a threat to us as long as she is in
Rome. What if some strong, ambitious general or senator, for example,
should marry her and undertake to displace Tiberius?&rdquo; He
sat back and gestured with outspread palms. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, Centurion?
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
And displacement of Tiberius&mdash;and me&mdash;would be disastrous
for your father, of course, and for you. You and I must work
together just as your father and I have been doing. So I shall look
forward not only to your frequent reports of a military and administrative
nature, particularly with respect to the collection
of revenue, but now that Claudia is going out there, to tidbits of
information concerning her and Pilate.&rdquo; His sensual lips thinned
across his teeth. &ldquo;Claudia must be kept away from Rome, Longinus,
but she must be kept happily away, too. So if you can
help make her stay in Judaea pleasant, if you can help Pilate keep
her satisfied, or if you can keep her satisfied,&rdquo; he added with a
leer, &ldquo;you will be serving the Emperor and me, your father, and
yourself. And I don&rsquo;t care <i>how</i> you do it. Be careful to avoid
scandal, though, that might reach Rome.&rdquo; He grinned again. &ldquo;I
think you need have little fear of Pilate.&rdquo; His lips were twisted
in an evil smile. &ldquo;Now have I answered your question, Longinus?
Do I make myself entirely clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, sir.&rdquo; Longinus&rsquo; countenance was impassive, he hoped,
but his palm itched to be doubled into a fist that would smash
the leer off the Prefect&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then these are your orders. Three days hence the &lsquo;Palmyra&rsquo;
sails for Palestine. Aboard will be a maniple of troops to relieve
two centuries of the Second Italian Cohort. You will command
a century that will be stationed at Caesarea under Sergius Paulus.
Centurion Cornelius will command the other. Also aboard will be
Tetrarch Herod Antipas. You and your century will go ashore at
Caesarea, but Cornelius and his will accompany Herod to Joppa.
There they will land, and Cornelius will escort the Tetrarch to
Jerusalem. Ostensibly Herod will be going up to the Temple to
worship, but he will be bearing a message from me to old Annas,
the former high priest.&rdquo; He paused but did not explain further.
&ldquo;From Jerusalem,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;Cornelius will escort Herod to
Tiberias, where the century will be stationed, with a garrison post
at Capernaum supporting it. And now, to get back to you, Longinus,
I have dispatched orders to Sergius Paulus that although
you will command a century, you must be allowed leave any time
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
you request it to undertake special missions. I indicated to him
that these missions would be concerned primarily with the government&rsquo;s
interest in the operations of your father&rsquo;s factories in
Phoenicia. This work understandably could take you to the plants
in Phoenicia and also to Tiberias, Jerusalem, and other regions in
Palestine. The cohort commander must never suspect, nor anyone
else, including Claudia, remember, that you are keeping sharp
eyes and ears on Pilate and Herod Antipas. I&rsquo;m sending you ahead
on the &lsquo;Palmyra,&rsquo; Longinus, so that you will be in Caesarea when
Pilate and Claudia arrive there.&rdquo; He studied the centurion. &ldquo;Is
everything understood, Centurion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I understand.&rdquo; His forehead creased into small
wrinkles. &ldquo;When you talked with me before, sir, you said that I
would be expected to keep watch on the activities of three persons,
Pilate, Antipas, and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claudia, of course, was the third.&rdquo; He twisted his vulture-like
head to scan the large chamber, a habit developed during long
years of caution. &ldquo;Watch her, too. Know what she is doing, what
she is thinking even, if you can.&rdquo; He lowered his voice. &ldquo;Be careful,
Centurion. She&rsquo;s a clever woman, with brains worthy of old
Augustus. I am not concerned, as I said, with her morals, or
Pilate&rsquo;s, or yours. But be careful.&rdquo; His little eyes fired again, and
a wry grin twisted his face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Pilate catch you in bed
with her. Such carelessness might destroy your effectiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sejanus stood up, a signal that his business with the centurion
was finished. Longinus arose quickly to stand at attention, concerned
that even yet he might reveal in the Prefect&rsquo;s presence
the revulsion mounting within him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send me reports as often and as regularly as you have valuable
information to give, Longinus. Use great care to see that your
messages are well-sealed and not likely to go astray. Watch those
three. Let nothing of significance escape your notice, and let nothing
be omitted from your reports. Keep Claudia under surveillance,
but don&rsquo;t get so occupied with her that you aren&rsquo;t fully alive to
everything that is happening. Watch her, regardless of what else
you two may be doing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c9">9</h2>
<p>Longinus led his century from its quarters at Castra Praetoria
westward through the Viminal Gate along the way that skirted the
leveled-out northern extremity of Esqueline Hill.</p>
<p>At the point where this way joined Via Longa the procession
entered the cobblestoned street and moved westward and then
straight southward. Longinus glanced over his shoulder and had
a glimpse, between shops that crowded the lower level of Quirinal
Hill, of his father&rsquo;s great house high on that elevation. But quickly
he lost sight of it as his century became virtually submerged in the
dense traffic fighting its way slowly along Via Longa. Fortunately,
the legionaries were bearing only their lightest armor; the heavier
gear had been sent ahead and put aboard the &ldquo;Palmyra.&rdquo; But even
thus equipped, in the narrow, packed street, though it was one
of Rome&rsquo;s important thoroughfares, they were finding it increasingly
difficult to maintain a steady march.</p>
<p>As the century began to pass north of the crowded Subura, that
motley district of massed tenements, shops, taverns, and brothels
already being pointed out as the birthplace more than a century
ago of the great Julius Caesar, the press of the throng so increased
that the soldiers were almost forced to fight their way forward.
But progress became easier in the area below the Forum Augustus,
and as the troops were pushing past it toward the Forum
Romanum, Longinus glanced toward the summit of Palatine Hill
crowned by the sprawling great Imperial Palace; his eyes went
immediately to the northeast wing and to the window in Claudia&rsquo;s
bedroom through which he had heard, one recent morning, the
rising trumpet call from the post.</p>
<p>Longinus had not seen the Emperor&rsquo;s stepdaughter since the
day the Prefect had visited her, though they had exchanged messages
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
left with Stephanos the goldsmith at his shop in Vicus
Margaritarius. Claudia&rsquo;s last message had assured him that she
would contrive some plan for seeing him immediately upon her
arrival with Pilate at Caesarea; that shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult.
Tullia had relayed Claudia&rsquo;s message to Stephanos, and Longinus
had received it verbally from the goldsmith. &ldquo;We will have the
Great Sea between the Emperor and Sejanus and us,&rdquo; she had
sent word to the centurion. &ldquo;It will be much safer then; as for
Pilate, I am little concerned with what he thinks or does; in fact,
he&rsquo;ll do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the Forum Romanum Longinus led his troops straight
southward. At the northwest end of Circus Maximus they veered
westward and went along the way leading across the Tiber on
the ancient Pons Sublicius, fashioned of great stones fitted together
to span the swiftly flowing muddy water. Near the bridge
entrance the column turned left and paralleled the stream to
halt at the pier just below the Sublicius. Quickly the legionaries
went aboard the &ldquo;Palmyra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus&rsquo; troops were the last to embark, and within an hour
the &ldquo;Palmyra&rdquo; began slowly to shove its stern out into the stream.
When the ship was safely away from the pier, the hortator gave
a sharp command, and the long oars, manned by galley slaves
chained to their three-tiered benches, rose and fell in perfect
cadence, with the starboard oarsmen pushing forward and those
on the port side pulling hard, so that the &ldquo;Palmyra&rsquo;s&rdquo; bow came
around; soon the vessel was moving steadily downstream.</p>
<p>Longinus and Cornelius, having stowed their gear, returned to
the deck to stand together on the port side near the stern. By
now the vessel was rounding the slight westward bend in the river
and was passing the Aventine Hill. Cornelius, watching the yellow
waters churning in the wake of the &ldquo;Palmyra,&rdquo; raised his eyes
and pointed across the stern toward the Imperial Palace, the western
front of which they could see jutting past the squared end of
the Circus Maximus. The upper section of the great palace was
visible above the race course. &ldquo;Longinus, I&rsquo;m surprised you&rsquo;re leaving
her in Rome. I thought that if you ever went back to Palestine,
you&rsquo;d be taking Claudia with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Longinus wondered if by some chance Cornelius had learned
of the Emperor&rsquo;s plans for his stepdaughter and was trying now
gently to probe further. &ldquo;But the night you came to her house
for me was the first time I&rsquo;d seen her after returning from Germania,&rdquo;
he protested, laughing. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a little fast?
She&rsquo;s the Emperor&rsquo;s stepdaughter, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe I was imagining things.&rdquo; Cornelius shrugged.
&ldquo;But she is a beautiful woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree, Cornelius. The Bountiful Mother was lavish with her
gifts to the Lady Claudia.&rdquo; He turned to lean against the rail.
&ldquo;What <i>I&rsquo;m</i> wondering, though, is why Herod didn&rsquo;t marry Herodias
and bring her along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he has married her. But I suspect that whether he has
or not, he&rsquo;ll be returning to Rome for her before many months.
That is, after he&rsquo;s made peace with the Tetrarchess and old King
Aretas, her father.&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d wager, too, that you&rsquo;ll be
coming back for Claudia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus laughed but made no comment. His friend, he reasoned,
did not know about Claudia and Pontius Pilate. Nor
would he tell him yet.</p>
<p>Now the &ldquo;Palmyra&rdquo; was moving swiftly, its cadenced oars rising
and falling rhythmically to propel the vessel much faster
downstream than the current unaided would have borne it. They
had come opposite the thousand-foot-long Emporium huddled
on the Tiber&rsquo;s eastern bank, its wharves crawling with slaves moving
great casks and bales of merchandise into the warehouses or
bringing them out to be loaded aboard ships preparing to slip
down the Tiber and into the Great Sea at Ostia. Black Ethiopians
and Nubians, their sweating bodies shining as though they had
been rubbed with olive oil and naked except for brightly colored
loincloths, straggled at their tasks. Blond warriors brought from
Germania as part of some Roman general&rsquo;s triumph, their skins
now burnt to the color of old leather, and squat, swarthy men
from Gaul and Dalmatia, from Macedonia and the Greek islands,
captives of Roman legionaries ranging far from the Italian mainland,
pulled and shoved to the roared commands of the overseers
and the not infrequent angry uncoiling of long leather whips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever realize, Longinus, what a comprehensive view
you get of Rome and the Empire from a ship going along the
Tiber?&rdquo; Cornelius nodded toward the stern. &ldquo;Look at those
marble-crowned hills back there, literally overrun with palaces, billions
of sesterces spent in building them, hundreds, thousands of
lives used up, sacrificed, raising them one above the other. The
people in them, too, Longinus, and the rottenness&mdash;smug hypocrisy,
adherence to convention, infidelity, unfairness, utter cruelty,
depravity. Rome, great mistress of the world. Hah!&rdquo; He half
turned and pointed toward the Emporium. &ldquo;Those sweating slaves
over there would agree.&rdquo; He gestured with opened hands. &ldquo;Ride
down the Tiber and see Rome, glorious Mother Rome, from
Viminal&rsquo;s crown to Emporium&rsquo;s docks, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Longinus smiled. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s only because the
gods have decreed for us a different fate that you and I are not
over there heaving crates, or chained here pulling oars.&rdquo; He leaned
over the rail and studied the rhythmical rise and fall of the long,
slim oars. &ldquo;No doubt there are among these slaves several whose
intelligence, education, and culture are considerably greater than
the hortator&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;m sure.... Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius followed the direction of Longinus&rsquo; outstretched arm.
One of the oars had come up beneath a floating object and sent it
spinning and twisting in the churning muddy flood. Now another
oar&rsquo;s sharp blade struck the object, ripping apart its once carefully
folded wrapping; as the oar cleared the surface, the wrapping
unrolled, exposing the body of a tiny infant, chalk-white in the
yellow water. It spun giddily for a moment, then sank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the gods!&rdquo; Cornelius shouted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an exposed baby girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now the small, lifeless body bobbed to the surface and for
one unruffled moment lay on its back, eyes wide-open and fixed,
staring upward unseeing toward the two centurions leaning over
the ship&rsquo;s rail. In that same instant the oars descended, and the
knife-sharp edge of one near the stern sliced diagonally across
the drowned infant; the oar shivered with the unexpected added
burden, but it bore the mangled small corpse beneath the thick
waters, and up through them rose a trickle of dark crimson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t dead when she was thrown in,&rdquo; Cornelius said,
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
&ldquo;and that wasn&rsquo;t long ago. Perhaps from one of the bridges back
there, or maybe a wharf. Or even a boat ahead.&rdquo; His shoulders
trembled in an involuntary shudder. &ldquo;Longinus, I could kill a
man in battle without blinking, but I couldn&rsquo;t throw an infant
into the Tiber. By the gods, how can any man do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, hundreds do it every year, Centurion. We were
speaking of those slaves over there on the Emporium&rsquo;s docks and
these galley slaves rowing us. And this drowned baby, and countless
others who simply lost when the gods rolled the dice. The
fickle gods, my friend, the unfeeling, stonehearted gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame the gods, Longinus. Blame rather Rome&rsquo;s mounting
vanity and greed, her selfishness, cruelty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not blaming the gods, Cornelius; I have no
more faith than you have even in their existence. They are nothing
but pale nobodies, fabrications in which not even intelligent children
believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fabrications, yes. Our gods are inventions, but they serve a
purpose and are necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Necessary?&rdquo; The centurion&rsquo;s face had twisted into a heavy
scowl. &ldquo;Why, Cornelius?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they fill a place, supply a need, Longinus. It&rsquo;s the
nature of man to look to some higher power, isn&rsquo;t it, some greater
intelligence? Else why would one invent these gods; why would
primitive peoples carve them from wood and stone; why would
we and the Greeks and the Egyptians raise great temples to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you contend then that people worship these carved sticks
and stones as symbols of some higher intelligence and power rather
than the carved objects themselves, even primitive peoples? Is that
what you&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m saying. Some&mdash;many, in fact&mdash;have
become confused, of course, and in seeking to worship this mysterious
divinity they go through a form or ceremony of worshiping
the symbol. But what I&rsquo;m trying to say, Centurion, is that it is the
nature of mankind to look to something higher, something more
intelligent, more powerful, better, yes, than man himself, better
even than such an exemplary man as our beloved&rdquo;&mdash;now his tone
was sarcastic&mdash;&ldquo;Emperor, or his most worthy Prefect. And if man
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
seeks such a being to worship&mdash;and all men, mind you, even
savages, even those wild tree worshipers in Britannia do it&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t
it stand to reason that there should be such a being?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Palmyra&rdquo; had entered the smooth bending of the Tiber
and was moving rapidly toward the river&rsquo;s nearest approach to
Janiculum Hill, Rome&rsquo;s Jewish quarter on the west bank of the
stream. Longinus pointed to the steep rise of the hill and the
plane before it cluttered with the densely massed homes of thousands
of Jews, many of them born in the capital, others newly
settled there. &ldquo;It seems to me, Centurion, that you&rsquo;ve become
an adherent of the Jewish one-god religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words amused Cornelius. &ldquo;Other Romans at our post in
Galilee have charged me with the same thing. It came about, I
suppose, from my helping the Jews at Capernaum build their new
synagogue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then surely you must be a member of their fellowship or
synagogue ... whatever they call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m no convert to the Jews&rsquo; religion, Centurion. I don&rsquo;t
belong to the synagogue. I helped them, I told myself, in order to
promote good relations between the Jews in Galilee and the members
of our small Roman post. But maybe I had other reasons,
too. There are many things about their one-god religion that seem
sensible and right to me. But there are also practices among the
Jews that I don&rsquo;t approve of at all, practices that seem cruel and
senseless. Their system of sacrifices, for instance. I can see no
act of proper worship in slitting the throats of innumerable sheep
and cattle to appease an angry god....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree. But we do the same thing. Doesn&rsquo;t the Emperor dedicate
the games by slitting the throats of oxen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. But what is the good of such worship or ceremony
or whatever you may choose to call it? If there is a god to whom
the sacrifice is being made, what good does it do him, what pleasure
could he possibly receive from it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing to any of it, Cornelius. Roman, Greek, Egyptian,
Jewish, forest worship in Britannia, whatever the system is;
it&rsquo;s all superstition, delusion....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grant you, maybe it is. But, Longinus, don&rsquo;t you feel deep
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
down inside yourself that there must be some intelligence, some
power, far above man&rsquo;s very limited intelligence and power, that
created the earth and the heavens and controls them? Else how
did they get here in the first place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Cornelius. You&rsquo;ve gone ahead of me, my friend.
I never gave much thought to matters like this.&rdquo; The lines of his
forehead wrinkled into a frown. &ldquo;But even if you <i>should</i> feel
that way, how could you ever <i>know</i>? Have you seen a god, Centurion?
Have you ever felt one or heard one speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen one, Longinus. But I think I have felt and
perhaps heard one. There have been times when I was confident
that I was communicating with one.&rdquo; Cornelius watched the
spume thrown up by the flashing oars as they cut into the muddy
waters. He turned back to face Longinus. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the difficulty,
you know, communication. How can one get a grip upon a god&mdash;the
god, if there be but one, and the way I see it that is the only
sensible answer&mdash;like those slaves down there grip the oar handles?
How can one hear a god, see him, taste him? Obviously, one cannot,
for this god, whether there be one or many, must be different
from man; he must be a spiritual being rather than a physical
one. But if he is a spirit, how can we of the physical world communicate
with him and he with us? There, my friend, is the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus shook his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me, Cornelius. I cannot
imagine a spirit, a being without a body, a something that is
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many persons can&rsquo;t, Centurion. And that&rsquo;s the main difficulty
in accepting the Jews&rsquo; Yahweh, their one god. He is a spirit, they
say, without physical form or substance. They believe in him, but
how do they know him, how do they learn what he&rsquo;s like? In a
word, if he does exist, how can he be made comprehensible to
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus smiled indulgently. &ldquo;But you say you think you have
felt one and maybe heard one. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can explain. Maybe it goes back to the fact
that my first lessons were taught me by a Greek slave. He was
purchased by my father from a lot brought to Rome after one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
those early rebellions. This man was one of the wisest I have
ever known. I shall never forget his teaching concerning the
gods. When we would speak lightly of our Roman gods, old
Pheidias would scold us. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak disparagingly of the gods,&rsquo;
he would say, even though he himself did not believe in them. I
can still remember his words. &lsquo;The gods,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;are symbols
of man&rsquo;s efforts to attain a higher life, a more noble plane of living.
The good gods are the symbols of the good attributes in man;
evil gods symbolize the base passions. Therefore, hold communion
with the good gods, and seek to avoid contact with the evil ones.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how does that teaching explain what you feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Cornelius smiled, then continued. &ldquo;Sometimes Pheidias
would confide in us and talk in more intimate terms of his own
philosophy. At such times he would tell us that his own gods
were merged into one omnipotent and omniscient good god, a
spirit without a body, everywhere present. This one god was a
synthesis of the good, the true, and the beautiful. And though
he could not be felt, as I feel this rail here&rdquo;&mdash;Cornelius ran his
hand along the ship&rsquo;s rail&mdash;&ldquo;and though he was not to be seen
or heard as one sees or hears another person, he was nevertheless
even more real. &lsquo;For the only things that are real,&rsquo; my tutor would
say, &lsquo;are the intangible things, and the only imperishable things
are those that have no physical being. Truth, for example. Truth
has no body. Who can hold truth in his hand? And yet truth
is eternal, unchangeable, indestructible. And love? Who can destroy
love; who can defeat it? Yet can you put love in a basket
and carry it from the shop? And who can measure a modius of love
or weigh out twelve unciae?&rsquo;&rdquo; Calmly he regarded Longinus.
&ldquo;And I ask you, my friend, who can? What, after all, is more indestructible,
unchangeable, immortal than the intangible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Palmyra&rdquo; was moving around the river&rsquo;s bend now and
gaining speed as it came into the straight stretch at a point even
with the right-angled turning of the city&rsquo;s south wall. &ldquo;But forgive
me, Longinus,&rdquo; Cornelius said lightly. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t meant to be
giving you a lecture on the nature of the gods or the one god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been entertaining and enlightening, my friend. And it
has convinced me that you do hold with this one-god idea. Those
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
Jews at Capernaum, cultivating the plant that came up from the
seeds that old tutor sowed in your childhood, have brought it
along to blooming.&rdquo; He laughed and tapped the rail with the
palm of his hand. &ldquo;Well, perhaps it&rsquo;s an advance&mdash;from the
Roman gods to the Jews&rsquo; one god&mdash;in superstition.&rdquo; But then the
patronizing smile was gone, and he was serious. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,
Cornelius. This one-god scheme does have its merits, I can see.
I would like to believe, and I wish I could, that such an all-powerful,
all-wise, all-good being rules the universe. But&rdquo;&mdash;he paused,
and a heavy frown darkened his countenance&mdash;&ldquo;Cornelius,&rdquo; he
began again, &ldquo;I keep thinking of those slaves back there on the
Emporium docks, countless slaves all over Rome and throughout
the Empire, beaten, maimed, killed at the whims of their masters,
yes, and that baby thrown into the Tiber, numberless unwanted
babies exposed to die&mdash;drowned, thrown to the beasts, bashed
against walls&mdash;and yet you say that one good god rules, one all-powerful
and all-knowing god, one <i>good</i> god.&rdquo; He thrust forth a
quivering, challenging forefinger almost under his friend&rsquo;s nose.
&ldquo;Then tell me, Cornelius, why does your good one god send all
this ignorance, this stupidity, this cruelty, this despicable wickedness
on the world? Tell me why; give me one logical, sensible
reason, and I&rsquo;ll fall down at the invisible and intangible feet of
your great one god and worship him in utter subjection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you, Longinus. That very question has troubled me,
too. I have wondered, and I&rsquo;ve tried to explain it for myself. I
don&rsquo;t know how old Pheidias explained it, or even if he did. I
don&rsquo;t recall our ever challenging him on that point. But it may
be that this one god&mdash;if there be one, mind you&mdash;does not ordain
all the things that happen in the world. It may be that he is even
sorrowful, too, because babies are thrown into the Tiber, because
men are cruel and heartless toward other men....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if he is all-powerful, Cornelius, why does he permit it?
You say he doesn&rsquo;t will it. Then why does he allow it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius looked across the deck to the shore line on the
starboard side and for a long moment silently considered his
friend&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;I cannot say, Centurion; it&rsquo;s a mystery to me.
Could it be, though, that the answer, if there be any answer, lies
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
in this god&rsquo;s determination to give man his freedom? Could it be
that even though he is hurt when man abuses the freedom given
him, he feels that his children must be free, nevertheless, to work
out their destinies? Maybe some such reasoning might explain it.
I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He shook his head sadly. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I disagree, Cornelius. You say that this one god would not
order an infant thrown into the river. I agree, but that is not
enough. A good god would not permit it.&rdquo; His grim expression
relaxed, but he was still serious. &ldquo;No, when one sees the condition
in which countless men live, the utter unfairness of things,
one cannot logically believe in the existence of such a god as you
have described. Indeed, it is more logical to believe in our Roman
gods than in the god of your old tutor or the Yahweh of the Jews,
in our good ones contending with the evil ones&rdquo;&mdash;he shrugged&mdash;&ldquo;with
the evil ones usually winning. But it is even more logical,
Cornelius, to believe in no gods at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a good argument, Longinus. But it seems to me
that we invariably come back to what I said when we started this
gods discussion. If there is no higher intelligence, no supreme
power, then how did all this&rdquo;&mdash;he swept his arm in a wide arc&mdash;&ldquo;how
did we, the world, the sun and moon and stars, everything,
how did it all come into existence in the first place? By accident?
Bah! And if not by accident, how? Answer me that, Longinus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer you. But why should I? What difference does
it make? If this good god does exist but does not rule, if he does
not enforce a good way of living among men, if he does not protect
helpless babies or captured peoples&mdash;and obviously he doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;is
the world any better off than if no gods existed in the first
place?&rdquo; He smiled complacently. &ldquo;But, Cornelius, I have no quarrel
with your attachment to your tutor&rsquo;s strangely Yahweh-like
god. Some day when I visit you in Capernaum I may go with you
to the synagogue or even the Temple at Jerusalem. I may even,&rdquo;
he added with a grin, &ldquo;offer a brace of doves for the sacrifices. Or
would your Yahweh insist on my offering a young lamb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> Yahweh? But I&rsquo;m no Jew, Longinus. The god of old
Pheidias has a greater appeal to me than Yahweh. Yahweh is too
stern, too unbending, as they interpret him. But maybe they interpret
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
him wrong, the priests who lead the worship, or maybe I
interpret their interpretation wrong. It may be that the true one
god&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;if there be one, my friend, has never been
properly interpreted to man. Maybe we just don&rsquo;t know him, what
he&rsquo;s like.&rdquo; He shrugged and stepped away from the rail. &ldquo;But
I think we&rsquo;ve had enough of gods for one day, don&rsquo;t you agree?
Let&rsquo;s go inside. I&rsquo;ve got some work to do before we reach Ostia;
you probably have some, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they started toward the cabin, Longinus turned to look
back. Rome was entirely behind them now, off the port stern, but
still clearly in sight. Above the city wall and the Aventine Hill
beyond and now lifted clear of the Circus Maximus, the sprawling
great Imperial Palace atop Palatine Hill flaunted itself in the sunshine.</p>
<p><i>Had Claudia arisen? Was she now in her bath or in the solarium
having her hair dressed or her nails manicured? Was she in the
peristylium or on the couch in the exedra? Was she making preparations,
not too reluctantly perhaps, for her wedding with Pontius
Pilate?</i></p>
<p><i>... Yes, and back there somewhere in that press of humanity
were Pontius Pilate and the Prefect Sejanus, by all the gods. By
all the gods, indeed. Good gods and evil gods, good to Pilate,
evil to me....</i></p>
<p>Longinus abruptly faced about. Ahead, straight over the bow
of the &ldquo;Palmyra,&rdquo; gaining momentum now in a channel clearing
of the jam of traffic within the city&rsquo;s walls, was Rome&rsquo;s port of
Ostia, where the great mainsail would be hoisted aloft to catch
the winds that would help speed the vessel eastward. Ahead and
many days and long Great Sea miles distant were the coasts of
Palestine ... and Caesarea. Ahead, too, despite all the gods, real
or fancied, and despite Sejanus and Pontius Pilate, was Claudia.</p>
<h2 title=""><span class="sc">Palestine</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/rose.jpg" alt="decorative glyph" width="78" height="77" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c10">10</h2>
<p>Longinus and Cornelius strolled over to the port bow rail as the
&ldquo;Palmyra,&rdquo; its mainsail sliding slowly down the mast behind them,
swung around the end of the north breakwater and skimmed
lightly across the harbor toward the docks at Ptolema&iuml;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Caesarea would be our first stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re putting in here only long enough to drop some passengers
and a quantity of goods Herod&rsquo;s brought from Rome,&rdquo;
Cornelius revealed.</p>
<p>Longinus looked up in surprise. &ldquo;Herod&rsquo;s goods?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furnishings for the palace at Tiberias&mdash;bronze tables, chairs,
decorative pieces, of Herodias&rsquo; choosing, I suspect. In fact, some
of it probably came from her house, favorite things to make her
feel more at home in Tiberias. Putting those crates ashore here
will save us the trouble of carrying them on to Joppa and Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when the Tetrarchess discovers that Herodias had a hand
in selecting the things....&rdquo; Longinus grimaced, laughing. &ldquo;Say,
are you letting your men go ashore here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for a few minutes, just to let them stretch their legs
while the vessel&rsquo;s unloading. Don&rsquo;t worry, they&rsquo;ve been told to
stay in the wharf area. If they were to get near the taverns and
brothels, we&rsquo;d be here all night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already the soldiers of the two centuries, impatient to get
ashore ever since they had first spotted Mount Carmel towering
above the promontory jutting out from the Phoenician coast,
were lining the &ldquo;Palmyra&rsquo;s&rdquo; rails. Cornelius beckoned to one of his
legionaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decius, call out a detachment&mdash;twelve men should be enough&mdash;to
be ready as soon as the &lsquo;Palmyra&rsquo; docks to take charge of
transporting the shipment of goods the Tetrarch Herod is sending
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
to his palace at Tiberias. His steward Chuza will put several of
the palace servants to unloading it and will arrange for obtaining
carts and beasts to move it. You will be concerned only with
guarding the caravan. But be on the alert every moment, Decius.
See that you aren&rsquo;t surprised by some lurking band of thieves lying
in wait for you. If anything should happen to this shipment, by
the gods, we&rsquo;d never hear the end of it; word would get back to
Rome and the Prefect himself would know about it.&rdquo; Upon delivering
the goods at the Tetrarch&rsquo;s palace, he added, Decius should
take the detachment to the garrison post and there await his arrival
with the remainder of the century, which would be escorting
Herod to Jerusalem and from there northward to his Galilean
capital.</p>
<p>When some two hours later the unloading had been completed
and the other legionaries had returned to the ship, Decius
stood with his detachment beside the piled crates and casks and
waved good-by to his comrades as the &ldquo;Palmyra&rdquo; moved slowly
away from the wharf and then, gaining speed, headed on a straight
course toward the harbor mouth. The next day the vessel cleared
the long breakwater thrust far out into the Great Sea to provide
a safe harbor at Caesarea, and Longinus and his century went
ashore. While the legionaries were assembling their gear, Cornelius
stood with him on the pier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come visit us at Tiberias, Longinus. You can contrive some
mission that will warrant your being sent, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked,
then added, &ldquo;Herodias will probably be coming out from Rome
before long. I suspect Herod will be going back for her as soon
as he can arrange with the present Tetrarchess for her to be supplanted....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he can&mdash;which I doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether he can amicably or not, I&rsquo;d wager that he&rsquo;ll be bringing
Herodias to Tiberias as Tetrarchess. Then Claudia can visit
her and you can meet her there. And marry her and keep her out
here until you&rsquo;ve completed your tour of duty.&rdquo; Cornelius winked
and playfully nudged his friend with an elbow. &ldquo;By the gods,
maybe that&rsquo;s what you and Claudia have planned all along. Is it,
Longinus?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t planned any such thing.&rdquo; Longinus stared
thoughtfully out at the shore before them. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll contrive
some reason for getting up to Tiberias. And we&rsquo;re bound to meet
in Jerusalem during one of the festivals; they bring in the troops
then, you know. Or perhaps some mission will bring you to
Caesarea; at Tiberias, after all, you&rsquo;ll be nearer us than we will be
to Jerusalem.&rdquo; He clapped a hand on his friend&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;My
love, and the blessings of the gods&mdash;including your Yahweh&mdash;to
your family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius stood at the &ldquo;Palmyra&rsquo;s&rdquo; rail as the vessel slipped
away from the wharf. When it was nearing the rounding of the
breakwater, he heard Longinus&rsquo; sharp command, and the century
moved off smartly. The tapping of the legionaries&rsquo; heavy boots in
rhythmical, perfect cadence came clearly to him across the water.
Longinus turned and lifted his arm high in salute; Cornelius returned
it, as the century, swinging along the cobblestoned way,
gained a street corner and turned, then began to be swallowed up
into the maze of stone buildings beyond the piers.</p>
<p>The sun was dropping low into the Great Sea when the
&ldquo;Palmyra&rdquo; sailed into the port at Joppa. Relieved and happy that
the long voyage was safely ended, the passengers disembarked
to seek refreshment and rest for the night. Early on the morrow
Herod Antipas with Mary of Magdala and the others of his company,
escorted by Centurion Cornelius and his century, would set
out on the forty-mile journey southeastward to Jerusalem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h2 id="c11">11</h2>
<p>Centurion Cornelius pointed to a horseman hurrying toward them
along the narrow road east of the river. &ldquo;The advance guard must
have run into trouble, maybe Bar Abbas and his gang or some
other waylaying zealots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better send out a patrol to overtake and destroy
them,&rdquo; Herod Antipas scowled. &ldquo;I have no patience with those
rebel cutthroats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caravan trudging up the deep trough of the Jordan had
paused for the midday refreshment. Four days ago it had descended
the Jericho road from Jerusalem to encamp for the night
on the plain before the city. Horses had been provided for the
Tetrarch and certain of his household, but the soldiers of the
century, with the exception of the small advance and rear patrols,
were on foot. Heavily loaded carts and donkeys transported the
supplies, gear, and tents. The journey had been made without
incident; another day of uninterrupted progress would bring the
caravan to the Sea of Galilee, or, if they were lucky, perhaps even
as far as Tiberias.</p>
<p>Cornelius stood up and signaled the approaching rider. The
horseman rode straight up to him, reined in his mount, and
saluted. &ldquo;Centurion,&rdquo; he reported, &ldquo;up ahead at the river crossing
there&rsquo;s a motley crowd of about a hundred persons, most of
them men. Judging by their appearance, they must have traveled
a long way. They appear to be peaceful, but there&rsquo;s a wild-looking,
hairy fellow haranguing them, and they&rsquo;re drinking in his
every word; they hardly noticed me when I joined them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the fellow saying, Lucilius?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t understand him, Centurion. I&rsquo;m not familiar with
the speech of this region, which I presume it was. But I thought
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
he might be one of those Galilean revolutionaries trying to incite
the crowd against our Roman rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of those zealots, you mean? No, hardly, Lucilius. Those
rebels don&rsquo;t stand up delivering speeches; their way is to thrust
a knife between somebody&rsquo;s ribs and then slink quickly away.
More than likely this fellow&rsquo;s a religious fanatic, and I would
guess his language is Aramaic. There&rsquo;s probably no harm in him,
but you did well to report. I understand Aramaic; I&rsquo;ll return with
you and investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I know who the man is, Centurion,&rdquo; the Tetrarch
volunteered. &ldquo;There was a desert fellow from the Wilderness
country beginning to cause a stir here when I was leaving for
Rome. I had reports then that he was thundering invectives
against everything, even the Tetrarch and his house. He may be inciting
the people against Rome. At any rate, I want to hear him,
and perhaps you should, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary of Magdala, seated near-by, had overheard. &ldquo;I, too, would
like to hear the strange prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely even your irresistible charms would not tempt this
mad Wilderness preacher.&rdquo; Antipas winked at the centurion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not interested in charming him. But if this is the man you
think he is I have heard much about him. I would like to observe
him for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius turned back to Antipas. &ldquo;If the Tetrarch wishes, I&rsquo;ll
send up a patrol to be near-by in case of any trouble. But I think,
Sire, you should disguise yourself. Then you will be able to mingle
safely with the throng, and the preacher, not knowing the Tetrarch
is hearing him, will talk freely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antipas, agreeing, quickly exchanged his purple mantle for the
simple Galilean garment of one of his servants and wrapped about
his Roman-style cropped head a bedraggled scarf to form an effectively
concealing headdress. The servant cut a reed to serve as a
walking staff. Mary, too, changed garments and veiled her face in
the manner of a Galilean peasant woman.</p>
<p>Cornelius sent a patrol ahead. &ldquo;Stop this side of the ford,&rdquo; he
instructed Lucilius, &ldquo;and try to avoid being noticed by the throng
down there. But keep on the alert for any commotion that might
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
develop.&rdquo; Then he, Antipas, and Mary all mounted horses and
rode toward the place where the multitude had assembled. At a
bend in the road some two hundred paces from the ford the three
riders dismounted behind screening thick willows that came up
from the river bank; from there they quietly made their way down
to the ford and slipped unobtrusively into the crowd.</p>
<p>Every burning dark eye seemed to be focused on the gesticulating,
fiercely intent preacher. He stood in the center of the circled
throng on the river bank, and his words came to them clear and
sharply challenging, angry and pleading, denunciatory and promising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You generation of vipers!&rdquo; he thundered, shaking a gnarled fist
in their teeth, &ldquo;have I not warned you to escape from the wrath
that is coming? Do you contend that because you are Abraham&rsquo;s
seed you are secure from the judgment of a righteous God?&rdquo; He
lowered his voice, strode two steps forward, and dramatically
wheeled about. &ldquo;What are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants to God? Could
he not raise up from these very stones&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed toward the
smoothly rounded small rocks lining the water&rsquo;s edge&mdash;&ldquo;children
for Abraham? And is not the ax ready at the foot of the tree to
cut down every one that does not bear fruit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius nudged a bent Jew, his face streaked with perspiration
that ran down in soiled small beads into his grizzled beard, his
whole frame seemingly so absorbed in the speaker&rsquo;s thundering
words that he had not even noticed the centurion&rsquo;s arrival beside
him. &ldquo;That man, who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old fellow turned incredulously to stare. &ldquo;Soldier, you have
been in Galilee long enough to speak our tongue, and yet you do
not know <i>him</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for many weeks I have not set foot in Galilee,&rdquo; Cornelius
replied. &ldquo;I am just now returning, by way of Jerusalem, from
Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the Prophet John, soldier, the one sent of God to warn
Israel to repent and be baptized.&rdquo; The old man turned back to
give his attention for the moment to the preacher. Then, his face
earnest, he confronted Cornelius again. &ldquo;He is not concerned with
Rome, soldier. He preaches only that men should cleanse their
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
hearts of evil and walk in the way of our Yahweh.&rdquo; Once more he
turned to stare at the prophet whose eyes were wildly flaming in
his burnt dark face; ignoring Cornelius, the old man leaned forward
and raised a knotted hand to cup his ear.</p>
<p>John was tall, and his leathery leanness accentuated his height.
The prophet, it was immediately evident to the centurion, was not
a man of the cities and the synagogues; he was a son of the desert
and the wastelands of Judaea, and the sun and wind had tanned
his skin to the color and hardness of old harness. Nor did he appear
any more afraid of the proud and opulent Pharisees and
Sadducees who confronted him with their disdainful smiles than
he must have been of the wild animals of his Wilderness haunts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repent! I say unto you. And bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.
Try not further the patience of God. Forswear evil and
do good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are for us fruits worthy of repentance? What must
we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The questioner, his countenance heavy with pain, stood at the
river&rsquo;s edge facing the prophet. His garb revealed him to be a man
of means, but it was evident also that the thundering words of
the baptizer had stirred him deeply and that he had asked the
question in all humility.</p>
<p>John thrust forth a lean forefinger and shook it sternly. &ldquo;You
are of a calling unloved in Israel, and justly so. You have sold your
birthright as a son of Israel to join your heel to the conqueror&rsquo;s to
grind Abraham&rsquo;s seed into the earth. You are a publican; I know
you, and I know the publican&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo; His voice was almost a hiss,
and around the clearing beards nodded in agreement with the
prophet&rsquo;s harsh appraisal. &ldquo;I call upon you to repent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what, Rab John, are the fruits of my repentance?&rdquo; The
perspiration was running freely down the man&rsquo;s face and dripping
into his beard. &ldquo;What must I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demand only that which is legally due you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear that this I shall henceforth do, Yahweh being my
helper. By the beard of the High Priest, I swear it.&rdquo; The man
sighed deeply, and from the fold of his robe pulled forth a kerchief
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
with which he mopped his forehead, his whiskered cheeks,
and the dampened long beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are not great ones,&rdquo; ventured a gnarled and grizzled
fellow who leaned twisted on his staff, &ldquo;neither are we publicans.
We are the plain and the simple and the poor of Galilee. What
shall we do worthy of repentance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have two coats, though they be worn and patched with
much wearing? Then give one to him who has none. And you have
food, though it be coarse and not plentiful? Share what you have
with him who is hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius had noticed, standing not far from the prophet but
somewhat withdrawn from the throng as if to avoid contamination
with these men of earth such as the one who had just questioned
John, a knot of resplendently robed Israelites, their beards oiled
and combed and carefully braided, their fingers heavily ringed.
Now one of these men, his hands clasped in front of his rounded,
sagging paunch, stepped forward a pace and bowed. &ldquo;Rabbi, we
are priests and Levites sent by the rulers in Jerusalem to hear and
observe your teaching. We perceive that you speak with great authority.
Tell us, Rabbi&rdquo;&mdash;his smile was as unctuous as his beard
was oiled&mdash;&ldquo;are you that great One for whom we are looking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not the Messiah,&rdquo; John answered evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you then the Prophet Elijah returned to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Rabbi, who are you? We have been instructed to come
and see and carry back our report to the Temple rulers. What
then shall we say of you, who you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say that I am:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Prepare ye the way of the Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Every valley shall be exalted,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And every mountain and hill shall be made low:</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And the crooked shall be made straight,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And the rough places plain:</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;You speak the words of the great Isaiah,&rdquo; the pompous questioner
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; John agreed. &ldquo;And other words he said also.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The voice said, &lsquo;Cry,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And he said, &lsquo;What shall I cry?</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;All flesh is grass,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;And all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;The grass withereth, the flower fadeth....</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;But the word of our God shall stand forever.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you, like we, yet look for the coming of the Messiah of
God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John raised a lean and burnt arm and the haircloth robe slid
down along it to his shoulder. He pointed a darting forefinger
toward the Temple&rsquo;s emissary, and his countenance was solemn.
&ldquo;I tell you, that One is now among us, though you have not recognized
him as the Messiah of God. And though he comes after me
in time, he ranks before me; indeed, I am not worthy to stoop down
and unloose his sandal straps. I baptize you with water, but He
will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Rabbi, why do you baptize with water?&rdquo; The unctuous
one smiled broadly and, pleased with his cleverness, looked from
one member of the delegation to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a sign that those who enter upon it have repented and
been cleansed in their hearts.&rdquo; He looked the man in the eyes.
&ldquo;Have you repented, my brother? Is your heart changed? Are you
ready for the coming of Him of Whom I have this moment
spoken?&rdquo; John whirled about, and his lean arm described an arc
that embraced the multitude. &ldquo;Repent, ye men of Israel! Ye who
dwell in great houses, repent! Ye men of earth who know not
where your next mouthful will be found, repent. For the clean in
heart do not all dwell in palaces or attend upon the Temple worship,
nor do they all go about hungry and naked and shelterless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the prophet paused, he looked toward the centurion and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
disguised Tetrarch, who stood beside Mary and within a few paces
of the portly questioner from Jerusalem. Cornelius wondered what
Herod was thinking of this strange Wilderness preacher, this fiery
denouncer of evildoers. But in that same moment John resumed
his discourse. &ldquo;No, sin and wickedness abide in the high places;
evil reigns even in the great marble pile built above the graves at
Tiberias where the Idumaean pawn of the conqueror despoils and
seduces the people of Israel! He, too, my brothers, even he must
repent his wicked ways; he must seek the Lord while yet He may
be found, or he and his evil associates will be cast into outer darkness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fleeting thought came suddenly to the centurion that the
prophet had recognized the large man in the soiled Galilean robe,
and perhaps the notorious woman of Magdala as well. But then
would he have dared utter such a denunciation? Was the desert
preacher really a man of dedication and courage, as people said?
Perhaps. Cornelius scrutinized Herod&rsquo;s face. The Tetrarch&rsquo;s normally
pale complexion had turned an ugly shade of red beneath
the twisted turban, while beads of perspiration ran down his heavy
jowls. But Mary, though little of her face showed because of the
veil, appeared more amused than angered.</p>
<p>The prophet&rsquo;s interrogator from Jerusalem was still unsatisfied.
&ldquo;But, Rabbi,&rdquo; he began again, &ldquo;you say that the Messiah of God
is already among us. Why then has he not declared himself, why
has he not consumed with holy fire the Edomite who possesses us
and tramples into the dust of utter subjection our ancient land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s eyes flashed angrily, but he controlled his tongue. When
he spoke his voice was calm. &ldquo;It is not for me to explain or defend
the will and works of the Messiah. I am but His messenger who
goes ahead to announce His coming, to call upon His people
Israel to repent that their eyes might be whole to see Him when
He comes, that their hearts might be clean to know Him!&rdquo; With
bronzed fist he smote the palm of his left hand, his ardor mounting.
&ldquo;You leaders of the people&rdquo;&mdash;he stabbed a lean forefinger
toward the haughty group from Jerusalem&mdash;&ldquo;cleanse your own
hearts; let fall from your eyes the scabs of greed and hypocrisy so
that when He comes you may recognize Him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Cornelius felt a gentle tug on his arm; it was Mary. &ldquo;The Tetrarch
is going back,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s furious at the man&rsquo;s
denunciation of him. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the fact that he would
have had to reveal his identity in doing it, Antipas would have had
him arrested. But he didn&rsquo;t want those puffed toads&rdquo;&mdash;she inclined
her head to indicate the Jewish delegation&mdash;&ldquo;carrying stories back,
and he wished to avoid provoking a commotion; so he overlooked
the....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius and the woman, her report to him startlingly interrupted
by the prophet&rsquo;s ejaculation, faced about quickly to look
in the direction toward which he was pointing. In that instant
the others had whirled about, too. Cornelius and Mary strained
forward, trying to see above the heads of the multitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the One of Whom I have been speaking!&rdquo; shouted John.
&ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
Yonder is the Messiah of God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They saw coming along the path that led down from the road
above the river, walking with long, easy stride as he descended the
grade toward the clearing at the ford, a tall, sunburned young man,
well-muscled but lithe, broad of shoulders, erect. He wore a plain,
brown, homespun robe, belted at the waist with a length of rope,
and coarse, heavy sandals. He was bareheaded; his reddish brown
hair fell away from a part in the center of his head in locks that
curled almost to his shoulders. In his right hand he gripped a long
staff cut from a sapling. As he strode down the pathway and across
the open space toward the prophet, he seemed deep in thought,
almost insensible to the throng about him. He walked straight up
to John. Cornelius and Mary could see the two talking in subdued
tones, but they could understand nothing of what was being
said by either man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they saying?&rdquo; It was the bent old Jew; he still stood
near-by, and he had cupped his palm to an ear lost in grizzled
earlocks. &ldquo;Soldier, can you hear them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a word,&rdquo; Cornelius answered. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t talking
loudly enough for us up here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>At that moment a youth who had been down at the water&rsquo;s edge
standing a few feet away from the prophet approached them. He
heard the old man&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;They are arguing about baptizing
the tall one,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;He wants the desert preacher to
baptize him, but the preacher claims it should be the other way
around; he says he isn&rsquo;t worthy to baptize the Messiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Messiah!&rdquo; The old man had been peering intently at the
tall young man standing calmly beside the prophet. &ldquo;Is that the
one the prophet called the Lamb of God, the one long expected of
Israel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the tall one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; Cornelius inquired of the bent one. &ldquo;Do
you know the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I know him?&rdquo; The old man chuckled. &ldquo;Soldier, I come
from Nazareth. Many&rsquo;s the day I have worked with Joseph, that
boy&rsquo;s father, planing one end of a beam while he was shaping the
other end. But Joseph&rsquo;s dead now, been dead a long time. That
boy there lives with his mother, the widow Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a carpenter, too, like his father before him. And he&rsquo;s a
good boy and a hard-working boy, soldier. But Jesus ben Joseph
the Messiah of Israel....&rdquo; The old fellow, both hands braced
on his gnarled stick, shook his head incredulously. &ldquo;Soldier, my
faith in that John the Baptizer is weakening. He must be&rdquo;&mdash;he
removed one hand from the stick and with bent forefinger tapped
his forehead&mdash;&ldquo;a little touched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius laughed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about this Messiah
business, but, I agree, he must be.&rdquo; Then he turned to Mary. &ldquo;Are
you ready to go? I mustn&rsquo;t let Herod get too far ahead. I&rsquo;m
responsible for his arriving in Tiberias, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started retracing their way along the path to the road;
where it joined the broader way, they turned southward. When a
moment later they came out from behind a clump of shrubs
grown up in an outcropping of small boulders, Cornelius glanced
over his shoulder toward the ford and the throng. He caught
Mary&rsquo;s arm and pointed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>The haircloth mantle and the brown homespun robe had been
thrown across small bushes at the river&rsquo;s edge. In the center of
the little stream, with the water up to their loincloths and their
faces lifted heavenward, stood the gaunt Wilderness prophet and
the tall bronzed young man from Nazareth.</p>
<h2 id="c12">12</h2>
<p>The Procurator&rsquo;s Palace sat high on a promontory overlooking the
harbor at Caesarea. A marble-paved esplanade led from the cobblestoned
street up to the palace, and on its west side facing the Great
Sea an immense terrace of colored, polished stones went out from
the peristylium.</p>
<p>In the days when King Herod, father of Antipas, determined
to build here on the Palestinian coast a fabulous port city to honor
his patron, the Emperor Augustus, the place was an insignificant
town called by the unusual name of Strato&rsquo;s Towers. Then there
was virtually no harbor. But at tremendous cost in the lives of
slaves and artisans and money wrung in taxes from his already poor
subjects, Herod built of huge stones sunk in twenty fathoms of
often rough water a tremendous mole that went out and around
like a protecting arm to form a safe shelter for countless ships of
every type.</p>
<p>Quickly old Herod had transformed Strato&rsquo;s Towers into a beautiful
and busy city more Roman than Jewish. A stranger unfamiliar
with the region and just landed from a trireme in the
harbor at Caesarea, in fact, would hardly realize that he was in a
Palestinian city. Not only were its great public buildings and lavish
homes Roman&mdash;its Procurator&rsquo;s Palace, its immense hippodrome
for athletic sports and gladiatorial combats, its theater, its gleaming
marble temples to pagan gods&mdash;but Roman, too, were many of its
people. Its population actually was of varied nationalities&mdash;Roman,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
Greek, Syrian, Idumaean, Ethiopian, and many others; there were
countless slaves from conquered provinces&mdash;Germania, Gaul, Dalmatia,
even here and there one from Britannia&mdash;a motley multitude
from every region on the rim of the Great Sea and even from
lands farther away. Caesarea was a metropolitan city set down
upon the coast of this ancient homeland of the Samaritans and
their more peculiarly Hebrew cousins the Judaeans.</p>
<p>Today the newly arrived Procurator Pontius Pilate and his wife
sat in the warming sunshine on the terrace and looked down upon
the busy harbor and the Great Sea stretching westward into the
blue haze. Obliquely facing them, so that he could see both the
harbor and a portion of the maze of buildings pushing one upon
the other from it, sat their guest, the Centurion Longinus.</p>
<p>Claudia pointed to a large merchant ship being tied up at one
of the docks below. &ldquo;This is a tremendous harbor, rivaling Ostia&rsquo;s,
isn&rsquo;t it? Look at all those vessels, and that one that has just sailed
in. Judging by its size, I&rsquo;d say it was an Alexandrian grain ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great harbor, and wonderfully protected. In fact, I was
amazed to find Caesarea such a modern city.&rdquo; Pilate smiled
broadly. &ldquo;I had feared that it would be another typical provincial
outpost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Excellency, it&rsquo;s quite a metropolis,&rdquo; Longinus
observed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll discover people here from every part of the
world, and far fewer Jews, I suspect, than you had anticipated
finding. Of course, you&rsquo;ve hardly had time yet to learn much about
the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate laughed, but with little humor. &ldquo;The fewer Jews the
better. I&rsquo;m glad the capital of the province is here rather than at
Jerusalem; it would be galling, I suspect, to be forced to spend
most of one&rsquo;s time in that nest of Jews. Speaking of Jerusalem,
Centurion, I plan to visit the city shortly and have a straight talk
with that High Priest. I wish it known at the very beginning of my
Procuratorship that I intend to demonstrate clearly and forcefully,
if that be necessary, that Rome cannot be trifled with by these
obstinate and pestiferous Jews. You, of course, have been to Jerusalem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since I came out this time. But on many occasions previously,
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
including visits during the festivals. If you go there during
Passover week, you&rsquo;ll see Jews from every part of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already seen enough of them for a lifetime,&rdquo; Pilate said,
scowling. But quickly he smiled again. &ldquo;Centurion, I am going to
the cohort&rsquo;s headquarters; I wish to talk with Sergius Paulus.&rdquo; He
clapped his hands, and a slave came running. &ldquo;Summon my sedan
bearers,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;May I take you to your quarters,&rdquo; he
asked Longinus, &ldquo;or will you stay longer and entertain Claudia?&rdquo;
He turned to his wife and smiled warmly. &ldquo;A familiar face, and a
Roman one, is particularly welcome in this strange outpost of the
Empire, isn&rsquo;t it, my dear Claudia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, Pilate.&rdquo; She reached over and put her hand lightly
on the centurion&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Longinus, do stay and talk. You can give
me instructions on how to act out here in this strange region,
strange to Pilate and me, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes the servant announced that the sedan bearers
were awaiting him, and Pilate excused himself. When he was gone,
Longinus moved his chair nearer Claudia. &ldquo;I wonder why he invited
me to stay,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Does he suspect us, do you suppose?
Or,&rdquo; he added with a wry smile, &ldquo;is there no longer any occasion
for his doing that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he suspects us, although I haven&rsquo;t yet learned
how to weigh his words or actions. But what if he does?&rdquo; She
shrugged. &ldquo;With me everything is just as it was before you left
Rome. But maybe&rdquo;&mdash;coyly she looked up at him from beneath her
long lashes&mdash;&ldquo;you have discovered some woman out here....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. And I haven&rsquo;t looked. But I wonder how much he knows
or suspects.&rdquo; He told her of his last conversation with the Prefect,
of the determination of Sejanus to keep her happily away from
Rome, of that wily rascal&rsquo;s invitation&mdash;in fact, almost command&mdash;to
do whatever might be necessary, including the invasion of the
Procurator&rsquo;s bed, to detain her in contented exile. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
think he suspected then that we were planning to get married almost
immediately. And I&rsquo;m sure Pilate didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; His forehead
wrinkled in deep study. &ldquo;By any chance, Claudia, have you let
slip...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About us, to him? Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;To anyone... Herodias maybe, the gods forbid. I wouldn&rsquo;t
trust that woman as far as I could throw that grain ship over there.
Could you, without realizing it, have let slip...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did tell Herodias. She does know that you and I were
planning to marry and come out to Palestine. But I&rsquo;m sure neither
she nor Antipas has said anything to Pilate about it ... if they&rsquo;ve
even seen him since. And certainly they haven&rsquo;t talked with
Sejanus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, Claudia, we must be doubly careful. So long as
Sejanus thinks I&rsquo;m simply keeping you ... satisfied, he called it,
it&rsquo;s all right. But should he get the notion that I might be planning
to take you away from Pilate and back to Rome ...&rdquo; he
broke off, scowling. &ldquo;And here there&rsquo;ll be other eyes and ears
watching and listening, too. But when Pilate goes to Jerusalem,
can&rsquo;t we arrange...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be going, too,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;And so must you. We can
contrive some excuse for your accompanying us.&rdquo; Her eyes were
bright with smoldering fires, he saw, and her lips warm, he knew,
and red and eager, and he remembered the taste of the Falernian
upon them. But adamantly he turned his eyes away to look toward
the great harbor. &ldquo;And in Jerusalem, Longinus, beloved&rdquo;&mdash;her
hand had caught his arm and was squeezing hard&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll find
some way.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c13">13</h2>
<p>Sergius Paulus, who commanded the legionaries escorting Procurator
Pontius Pilate and his party to Jerusalem, halted his
column several hundred paces west of the great market square outside
the Joppa Gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheathe the cohort&rsquo;s emblems!&rdquo; he commanded, and quickly
down the line of march the soldiers began covering the banners
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
of the Second Italian&mdash;the likenesses of the Emperor Tiberius, the
screaming eagles, the fasces with their bundled arrows and axes,
everything that flaunted the proud victories of this cohort of
Rome&rsquo;s conquering armies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Commander Sergius,&rdquo; Pilate began to protest, &ldquo;by whose
orders must Rome thus bow to these haughty Jews? Is this, by any
chance, <i>your</i> scheme for forestalling possible disorder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Excellency, the sheathing of the emblems in Jerusalem is
not of my devising; it follows a long established custom, started,
I believe, by the Emperor Augustus as a result of a pact with the
Jewish leaders and continued by the Emperor Tiberius through
orders transmitted to us by the Prefect Sejanus.&rdquo; His smile was
coldly professional. &ldquo;I assure you, sir, covering our emblems before
the gates of Jerusalem is as distasteful to me as it must be to the
Procurator, but this is an order I dare not violate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The round face of the helmeted Procurator reddened with fury.
He shook his head angrily and banged his heavy fist against the
apron of the chariot in which he stood beside his wife. &ldquo;I am not
accustomed to seeing Rome display humility&mdash;abject humility&mdash;which
is what this action seems to me to be. But I shall not
countermand the order you have given, though to me it is both
humiliating and exasperating that our legionaries are forced thus
to yield to these outrageous Jews.&rdquo; He raised his hand to signal.
&ldquo;When you are ready, Commander, let us proceed into the city.&rdquo;
Then he turned to address Longinus, who had halted near the
Procurator. &ldquo;Centurion, will you exchange places with my driver?
Claudia and I are entering Jerusalem for the first time; would you
be our guide and point out the principal places of interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly the exchange was accomplished, and the detachment,
its emblems shielded now from view, resumed its march. Crossing
the market place at the gate, a suddenly stilled large square that
a moment before the Romans&rsquo; arrival had been a hubbub of shouts
and shrill cries of bargaining, the procession moved through the
gateway to enter a narrow cobblestoned street also strangely deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are the people to welcome us?&rdquo; Pilate inquired, his
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
balding high forehead creased in anger and consternation. &ldquo;Why
this unnatural calm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have retreated inside their shops and houses and closed
the shutters; right now they are peering at us through lattices and
from the roof tops, Excellency. This is the way they show their
scorn for their conquerors. It will be our good fortune if we are
not pelted with rotten vegetables and fruit thrown from the house
tops, or even tiles from the roofs.&rdquo; He smiled, not too happily.
&ldquo;The Jews, Excellency, don&rsquo;t have much affection for us Romans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The veins in the Procurator&rsquo;s neck swelled as though they might
burst, and his countenance was livid. &ldquo;In every province in which
I have formerly entered with our troops,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;the populace
has welcomed us thunderously, often with flowers and
branches of trees thrown in our way, and many times they have
even prostrated themselves before us.&rdquo; He knotted his fist again.
&ldquo;By all the gods, I shall teach these Jews better manners. Nor
shall I delay long in setting them to their lessons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia laid a soothing hand on her husband&rsquo;s arm; with the
other she pointed to the right. &ldquo;Those huge buildings! Longinus,
they appear to be towers. And what tremendous stones. I didn&rsquo;t
know these Jews were capable of raising such structures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, on the contrary, the Jews are good artisans, and old Herod,
who built many great edifices here as well as at Caesarea and other
cities, also employed many foreign workers of great skill. He evidently
wished to emulate Augustus in raising magnificent public
buildings.&rdquo; They were coming now to a great square tower, one
of those to which Claudia had pointed. &ldquo;This first one is the Hippicus
Tower, named, I have heard, for a friend of Herod. The
next one, in the middle, is Phasael, called that in honor of Herod&rsquo;s
brother. But that one&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed in the direction of a third&mdash;&ldquo;is
the most famous, perhaps because he built it to the memory
of the only wife he really loved. It&rsquo;s called the Mariamne Tower,
after the one he had killed. They say that the old reprobate almost
went insane with grief after he&rsquo;d executed her. Claudia, this Mariamne
was the grandmother of Herodias and her spendthrift
brother Agrippa. Mariamne was a member of the ancient Hasmonean
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
line of Israelite rulers. Very soon now we&rsquo;ll be passing the
old Hasmonean Palace; it&rsquo;s over near the viaduct that connects
Zion Hill with the Temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Longinus, where is the Procurator&rsquo;s Palace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Centurion, I&rsquo;d be interested in seeing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s behind that wall joining the three towers, sir. And it&rsquo;s a
tremendous place, too, with fountains and flowers and grass and
trees&mdash;you will love it, Claudia&mdash;it serves as headquarters of the
Procurator when he visits Jerusalem, though it&rsquo;s called Herod&rsquo;s
Palace. When the Tetrarch is in Jerusalem, especially if the Procurator
is here at the same time&mdash;for instance, during Passover
feasts&mdash;the Tetrarch usually stays at the Hasmonean Palace. Excellency&rdquo;&mdash;he
faced the Procurator again, for he had been busy
with the reins in an attempt to dodge a heavily loaded cart being
pulled by a trudging donkey&mdash;&ldquo;do you plan to stop here at Herod&rsquo;s
Palace, or will you stay in the Procurator&rsquo;s quarters at the Tower
of Antonia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the custom of Valerius Gratus? Where did he stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He usually lodged here, I believe. It&rsquo;s more comfortable, of
course, and perhaps will be quieter than the quarters at Antonia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;Pilate faced Claudia, his expression questioning&mdash;&ldquo;then
we should stay at Herod&rsquo;s Palace. But, pray the gods, why
should it be called Herod&rsquo;s Palace now? The Herods no longer
have authority in Judaea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was built by old Herod, sir, and the name persists. Things
change slowly out here; tradition and custom rule in Judaea. I&rsquo;m
sure you&rsquo;ll realize that more the longer you remain in Palestine.&rdquo;
They were nearing a gate in the high wall that gave admittance
to the palace. Several guards at the gate, seeing the procession of
Roman troops, straightened and raised their arms in salute. Longinus
lifted the reins to halt the chariot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; Pilate said. &ldquo;Claudia wishes to see the Temple
and Antonia Tower before we stop. Don&rsquo;t you, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. Then, after I&rsquo;ve had a look at them, we can return, can&rsquo;t
we? And if the Procurator is kept at Antonia Tower longer than
he expects to be, perhaps the centurion would fetch me back
here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Longinus smiled. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he murmured, then turned to
Pilate. &ldquo;But, sir, you won&rsquo;t be able to proceed far with the chariots.
You&rsquo;ll have to change to horseback or be borne in a sedan chair.
These Jerusalem streets are very narrow, and many of them ascend
and descend stairs that a chariot could scarcely manage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate nodded. &ldquo;Thank you, Centurion. In that case we&rsquo;ll leave
the chariots here, and I&rsquo;ll ride horseback. Claudia can take a sedan
chair.&rdquo; He looked toward his wife, and his eyes were questioning.
&ldquo;That is, if she still wishes to go on to Antonia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d particularly like to see the Temple; I&rsquo;ve heard stories
of what a marvelous structure it is. I&rsquo;ll go on, and Longinus can
bring me back.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Pilate nodded. &ldquo;If you will, Centurion. Or I can send someone
to bring you here, Claudia, if the centurion finds that he cannot
get away from his duties. I&rsquo;ll probably be detained for some time
at the Tower. I am determined to see the High Priest before the
sun sets. I had planned to call on him at his palace, but now, after
the reception Jerusalem has given me, by all the gods&rdquo;&mdash;his face
was reddening again&mdash;&ldquo;I shall summon him to come to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the column was halted along the narrow way in front of
the sprawling Herod&rsquo;s Palace. The chariots were driven inside the
palace grounds and left there, and a sedan chair was brought out
by bearers quickly recruited from the palace&rsquo;s staff of servants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Centurion, if you will ride in the sedan chair with Claudia,&rdquo;
the Procurator said, &ldquo;you can point out to her the places of importance
in this nest of obstinate Jewry.&rdquo; He mounted a gaily
caparisoned horse and rode forward to the head of the column.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Excellency, it would be best for me to go ahead with
the advance guard&rdquo;&mdash;Sergius Paulus smiled grimly as Pilate came
abreast of him&mdash;&ldquo;to absorb the stones that may be hurled at the
new Procurator, not that there is any personal animosity toward
you, sir, but because you are a symbol of Rome&rsquo;s dominion....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m not afraid of them!&rdquo; the Procurator angrily interrupted.
&ldquo;And, by great Jove, I&rsquo;ll teach them to respect the dominion
of Rome!&rdquo; He spurred his horse several paces ahead of the
cohort commander.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Meanwhile Claudia and Longinus had settled themselves in the
sedan chair. As it moved off, they did not draw the curtains. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t because I am afraid to draw them,&rdquo; Claudia said to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not afraid of Pilate, nor am I afraid of the people out there. It&rsquo;s
because I want to see Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think Pilate might become suspicious, do you, or
even jealous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pilate thinks only of Pilate and how he can advance his own
fortune. He&rsquo;s ambitious and egotistical; he craves authority, and
he covets riches. He&rsquo;ll do nothing to displease me, not because of
affection for me, but because I&rsquo;m the stepdaughter of the Emperor
and because our marriage was arranged by the Prefect. If he&rsquo;s ever
jealous of me&mdash;and I think he never will be&mdash;I&rsquo;m quite certain he
will make every effort not to show it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it should not be difficult for us to contrive to see each
other....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia laughed. &ldquo;Are you, I hope, that eager?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been that eager for many weeks, Claudia.&rdquo; He leaned across
to take her hand. She drew it back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now, Centurion. The soldiers, you know....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are afraid of the Procurator&rsquo;s knowing....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not afraid, Longinus. Say, rather, discreet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now they were being borne down a flight of stone steps. The
hoofs of the horses in front of and behind them clattered and
slipped, and sometimes an animal would go to its knees, though
the heavily burdened donkeys coming up the stairs and keeping
close to the buildings managed to scramble forward on nimble,
sure feet. Sometimes a swaying load piled high on a donkey&rsquo;s back
would be overbalanced and topple as its containing straps burst,
and in a moment the merchandise would be trampled to bits by
the soldiers&rsquo; steeds.</p>
<p>When they reached the bottom of the steps and began to move
along a level portion of the street where there was an open space
between the buildings on the right, Claudia suddenly pointed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
&ldquo;That must be the old Hasmonean Palace where the ancestors of
Herodias&rsquo; mother lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She scowled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a stern and forbidding pile of stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that most Jewish public buildings are that way, the
palaces especially. But once you get inside them, you&rsquo;re bound to
find them enchanting. Herod&rsquo;s Palace has a sumptuous array of
grass and flowers and fountains; you should enjoy your stay there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; She smiled coyly. &ldquo;It depends.&rdquo; Then she pointed.
&ldquo;What on earth is that next building? It, too, looks like a fortress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That place is called the Xystus; it&rsquo;s a Roman-style gymnasium
built by King Herod, who also constructed down this way&rdquo;&mdash;he
pointed off toward the south&mdash;&ldquo;an open-air theatre and&rdquo;&mdash;he
nodded in the opposite direction&mdash;&ldquo;northeast of the Temple area
a large hippodrome where he held games and gladiatorial sports
modeled after ours at home. But the orthodox Jews will have
nothing to do with any of these things; they won&rsquo;t even go near
the places. To do so would violate some of their religious laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of the horses&rsquo; hoofs pounding ahead suddenly
changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we on a bridge?&rdquo; Claudia asked, as she leaned out left.
She rode facing forward, while Longinus sat opposite her, his back
to the streets unwinding ahead of them. &ldquo;Yes, I see we are,&rdquo; she
answered her own question. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a high one. Look, Longinus,
by the Bountiful Mother! That structure across there! It&rsquo;s ...
it&rsquo;s unbelievable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Temple,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Jews&rsquo; temple to
their Yahweh. And it is one of the most gorgeous&mdash;if that&rsquo;s the
proper word, Claudia&mdash;and costliest buildings in the world. It&rsquo;s
made of white marble, the finest cedarwood, and untold bronze
and other materials of the most extravagant quality, and trimmed
with sheet gold and precious gems. You&rsquo;ll see when we cross the
bridge and enter its walls.&rdquo; Their sedan chair was nearing the
middle of the viaduct now. &ldquo;See, it&rsquo;s a high bridge. It connects
Zion Hill, which we&rsquo;ve just left, with the Temple region. Over
there&rdquo;&mdash;he twisted about to point to the Temple on his right
and behind him&mdash;&ldquo;is Mount Moriah. Between the two hills is this
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
sharp drop called the Tyropoeon Valley; some call it the Valley
of the Cheesemongers. In festival times these hillsides swarm with
pilgrims coming from all over the world to worship at the Temple,
which they consider the residing place of their Yahweh.&rdquo; He
laughed, then gestured with outflung hands. &ldquo;But we should have
Cornelius here to be your guide. He knows far more about the
religious customs and beliefs of the Jews than I do; in fact, we
had quite a talk about it on the boat coming out, and I charged
him with being a worshiper of the Jews&rsquo; god himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the end of the towering viaduct the procession stopped,
and the soldiers dismounted. Quickly a litter was provided for the
Procurator, and then the marching column, with Pilate&rsquo;s sedan
chair in the vanguard and Longinus and Claudia some paces behind
him, moved off the viaduct and passed beneath a great arch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is called the Gate Shalleketh,&rdquo; Longinus told her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the main gate into the Temple area from the Zion section of the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m amazed that you know so much about Jerusalem,&rdquo; Claudia
began, then suddenly stopped as, startled, she caught sight of a
veritable forest of marble columns, gigantic, reaching upward out
of her range of vision from within the constricting sedan chair.
&ldquo;Bona Dea! Longinus, this is unbelievable! What a majestic structure!
And look how far it extends! It&rsquo;s mammoth, breath-taking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s only one of the porches, as they call it,&rdquo; Longinus
hastened to explain. &ldquo;This one is styled the Royal Portico of
Herod. Its marble columns, as you can see, are more than a hundred
feet high. And look, Claudia&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed behind, over his
shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;the colonnade itself runs almost a thousand feet. Have
you ever seen anything so fantastic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I&rsquo;m sure the High Priest couldn&rsquo;t be a bit more effective
than you in singing the Temple&rsquo;s praises,&rdquo; Claudia declared,
laughing. &ldquo;But it really is a marvelous structure these Jews have
built to their superstition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I agree. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I told Cornelius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The procession turned squarely to the left and started to emerge
from beneath the great roofed colonnade into the strong sunlight
of an immense open square.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is called the Court of the Gentiles,&rdquo; Longinus explained.
&ldquo;And over there is the Temple proper. Inside it is a place they
call the Holy of Holies. Only the High Priest himself, they say, is
permitted to enter it, and then only on a feast day, maybe once
a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that inside that room there&rsquo;s a golden head of an
ass and that the Jews actually worship this ass&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus smiled. It was an old story he had heard many times,
he explained, though never from a Jew. Perhaps it started, so far
as Rome was concerned at any rate, with the time that Pompey,
searching for treasure, invaded the holy shrine of the Jews. &ldquo;But
he found no golden head of an ass. He found only an empty
chamber, severe and forbidding, with nothing in it but a few
golden vessels and some furniture that was probably used as an
altar. That&rsquo;s the story the Jews tell, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this one god, Longinus, what did you say they call him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yahweh, or Jehovah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember. But where is he? Don&rsquo;t they have any statues
of him somewhere in the Temple, Centurion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, according to what I&rsquo;ve heard from the Jews themselves
and from what Cornelius has told me&mdash;and he knows far more
about their religious customs and beliefs than I do&mdash;statues are one
thing they definitely do not have. They declare that their god is a
spirit without body and to them any sort of representation in
physical form&mdash;whether it be statues, carvings, or whatnot&mdash;would
be sacrilege. That&rsquo;s why they were so violently opposed to our
bringing in unsheathed emblems. They have the strange belief that
our army emblems are what they call &lsquo;graven images,&rsquo; and their
laws expressly forbid any such thing. They won&rsquo;t even engrave the
head of a man or an animal on any of their coins.&rdquo; He shook his
head, as though scarcely able to believe his own words. &ldquo;Strange,
these Jews. But you will discover that for yourself before you&rsquo;ve
been out here many weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were coming opposite the eastern face of the Temple
proper. &ldquo;Look at that gate, or door!&rdquo; Claudia pointed again.
&ldquo;Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s tremendous! And it shines as though it were
gold!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;They call it the Beautiful Gate. It&rsquo;s made of Corinthian brass
and plates of gold, and it&rsquo;s so heavy it takes a score of strong men
to open and close it. They say it was given by a rich foreign Jew.
It must have cost many a sesterce, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it did.&rdquo; Her eyes were wide with disbelief. &ldquo;The whole
place is magnificent; why I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like....&rdquo; Suddenly
she clamped a hand to her nose. &ldquo;By all the gods, Longinus,
what an odor!&rdquo; She leaned her head out. &ldquo;Bona Dea, all that
cattle. No wonder that awful stench. What on earth are cattle and
sheep doing in this beautiful place, Longinus? Can it be for
sacrificing, by all the great and little gods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s for sacrificing.&rdquo; Longinus grimaced. &ldquo;The Jews think
that slitting an animal&rsquo;s throat and throwing the blood on that
great altar somehow cleanses them of their sins. I don&rsquo;t understand
how it could....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman&rsquo;s laugh was derisive. &ldquo;Bringing all those poor
animals in here to befoul this beautiful place, these gorgeous mosaics,
to pollute the very air, and they call that cleansing themselves.
Bona Dea, their Yahweh, if he demands this sort of worship, must
be a bloodthirsty god. It just goes to prove, Centurion, that this
one-god religion has less sense to it than even our silly superstitions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I told Cornelius. I see no efficacy in slitting the
throats of poor beasts and slaughtering countless doves and pigeons
in order to serve some god. Of course, so far as the priests are
concerned, it&rsquo;s a highly profitable business. But, of course, why
should we criticize the Jews when we do it in Rome, too, though
not on such a grand scale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few paces farther on, the procession turned squarely to the
left again and proceeded along a third side of the Temple enclosure,
past the stalls of the lowing, frightened cattle and the
cages of birds and the money-changers seated behind their tables.
From the long portico the marchers pivoted to the right, then
ascended steps that led to a wide, paved esplanade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the platform before the Tower of Antonia. We&rsquo;re coming
to it now.&rdquo; He motioned behind him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Roman military
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
headquarters in Jerusalem. But Pilate must have told you all
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned out and looked westward along the platform. &ldquo;Pilate
tells me very little,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;By the gods, it&rsquo;s a tall structure
and a grim-looking one. Doubtless overrun with soldiers, too,
even in the Procurator&rsquo;s private apartments.&rdquo; She winked and
smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Pilate decided to stop at the Herod Palace during
our visit to Jerusalem. He&rsquo;ll probably be here at Antonia much
of the time. It should be easier then to arrange things over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;her tone was playful, her eyelids fluttered teasingly&mdash;&ldquo;yes,
things for people to do ... two people.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c14">14</h2>
<p>It was past midnight when Longinus returned at last to the now
quiet Tower of Antonia. Before leaving Caesarea he had arranged
with Sergius Paulus to have little more than token duty during
the stay in Jerusalem. In the weeks since his arrival in Palestine,
he and the cohort commander had come to an understanding; although
Sergius knew little of the centurion&rsquo;s reasons for being in
this far eastern province, he did know that Longinus had been
sent out by the Prefect Sejanus, and Sergius was not disposed to
challenge, or even question actions of the Prefect.</p>
<p>Pontius Pilate had not returned to the palace; presumably he
had eaten his evening meal at the tower with the officers there. At
any rate, Longinus and Claudia had not been disturbed.</p>
<p>But when Longinus was admitted by the guards at the tower&rsquo;s
outer gate, he deliberately walked past the stairs leading to the
southwest tower, where the administrative offices, including the
Procurator&rsquo;s quarters, were situated. Going by the southeast tower
would take him a bit out of his way, Longinus reasoned, but he
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
would be less likely to run into the Procurator at this late and
embarrassing hour.</p>
<p>The centurion had been assigned quarters in the officers&rsquo; section
on a floor level with a great gallery along the Temple side of
Antonia; a protective rampart ran the length of this gallery, and a
door opened onto the gallery from each officer&rsquo;s quarters.</p>
<p>The air in the small chamber was musty and warm, and Longinus,
too, was warm from the exertion of his walk back to the
tower. He sat on the side of his bed for a moment, then stood up
and opened the outer door. When the draft of fresh air swept in,
he stepped out onto the gallery to wait there until his chamber
had cooled.</p>
<p>As he stood leaning on the rampart, Longinus heard a door open
behind him. Turning, he saw a soldier coming out. Another man
too warm to fall asleep, he thought, as he turned back to stare
at the still and almost deserted Temple enclosure. Fires smoldered
on the great altar, and flickering lamplight from the region of the
cattle and sheep stalls gave a look of eeriness to a scene that just
a few hours before had been a bedlam of sound and movement.</p>
<p>The other soldier halted near him to look down also on the
somnolent Temple. The man pointed over the parapet. &ldquo;Still an
amazing picture, even in the nighttime, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cornelius!&rdquo; Longinus said, recognizing the voice and whirling
around to face the other. &ldquo;By all the gods, man, I thought you
were in Galilee!&rdquo; He clapped a heavy hand on his friend&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad to see you, Centurion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I had no idea you were in Jerusalem, Longinus!&rdquo; Cornelius
responded with a shoulder-shaking slap. &ldquo;How long have you been
here? Did you come today with the Procurator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we arrived here a little past midday; we marched out of
Caesarea at daybreak day before yesterday. But, by Jove&rdquo;&mdash;he
pointed to a stone bench set against the rampart&mdash;&ldquo;let&rsquo;s sit down,
Cornelius. I&rsquo;ve had a hard day, and I&rsquo;m sure you have, too. When
did you get into Jerusalem, and did you bring your century?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came only an hour before sunset. Yes, I had orders from
the new Procurator to meet him here with my century.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why, pray Jove? It&rsquo;s no festival occasion. Can Pilate be
expecting trouble? He didn&rsquo;t indicate any such thing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why he should be anticipating any trouble,
so far as I can see ... unless he&rsquo;s planning to provoke it himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would he do that? He must know that Tiberius and
Sejanus are determined to keep our conquered dominions at peace,
if for no other reason than to insure the uninterrupted flow of
revenue. But&rdquo;&mdash;Longinus shrugged&mdash;&ldquo;maybe Pilate wants to make
a show of force in the hope of increasing that very flow&mdash;with the
increase going into his own pockets, of course&mdash;which might be
why he&rsquo;s been conferring at such length with Caiaphas and old
Annas.&rdquo; He pointed toward a lighted window high in the southwestern
tower. &ldquo;Look, they&rsquo;re still up there. Pilate didn&rsquo;t even go
to the Herod Palace for the evening meal with his new wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New wife? I didn&rsquo;t know Pilate was married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Since we left Rome. And you&rsquo;ll be surprised to learn who
she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claudia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the great gods! Longinus, I thought you would be marrying
Claudia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had planned to be married.&rdquo; Longinus paused. &ldquo;But Tiberius
and Sejanus made this other arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius shook his head. &ldquo;But what does Claudia say about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can she say? To them, I mean. But to me she declares
that nothing has changed between us. And judging by this afternoon
and tonight&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been with her ever since we reached Jerusalem
until a few minutes ago&mdash;nothing has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But couldn&rsquo;t that be dangerous for you two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus shook his head. &ldquo;I hardly think so. Their marriage was
an entirely arranged one, and furthermore, I&rsquo;m convinced Pilate
would do nothing to offend Claudia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me&rdquo;&mdash;Cornelius leaned forward and tapped his friend&rsquo;s
knee&mdash;&ldquo;you knew before we left Rome that this arrangement had
been made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I couldn&rsquo;t say anything about it then, Cornelius.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. You were in some kind of cross fire, weren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have an understanding or arrangement with Sejanus,
don&rsquo;t you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean about Claudia? Wait....&rdquo; He held up
his hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t answer that. But I do want you to remember,
Longinus, that regardless of what may happen, I&rsquo;m on your side
... yours and Claudia&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, my friend. And I&rsquo;m on your side ... regardless.
And it may be that sometime we&rsquo;ll need one another&rsquo;s support.
With old Tiberius and crafty Sejanus on the one hand and this
vain and ambitious Pilate on the other, and perhaps Herod Antipas....&rdquo;
With mention of the Tetrarch&rsquo;s name, he paused. &ldquo;I
assume you got him delivered to Tiberias in safety. What did his
Arabian Tetrarchess say about Herodias?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had heard about it before we reached Tiberias, perhaps
from some of that fellow Chuza&rsquo;s servants, the ones who fetched
the furnishings from Ptolema&iuml;s, you remember. But that was only
the beginning. Now they&rsquo;re wondering at the palace what she&rsquo;ll
do when Antipas gets back with his new wife; he&rsquo;s already left for
Rome, they say, to fetch her, and when Herodias arrives, she&rsquo;ll
probably be taking over as Tetrarchess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat for a long time in the coolness of the gallery high
above the sleeping Temple, and Cornelius related his experiences
in escorting the Tetrarch up the narrow defile of the Jordan River
and their encounter that day with the strange Wilderness
preacher. He described the man&rsquo;s bitter denunciation of Herod
and his sudden and dramatic pointing out of a tall young Galilean
carpenter as the Jews&rsquo; long looked for Messiah, the man foretold
by the ancient Israelite prophets as he who would redeem their
historic homeland from its bondage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we were leaving the place, I turned and looked back,&rdquo;
Cornelius added. &ldquo;The strange prophet and the tall Galilean were
standing in the river with the water up to their loincloths; the tall
one had asked to receive something they call baptism, a symbolic
cleansing of one&rsquo;s sins, as I understand it.&rdquo; Cornelius paused and
stared thoughtfully at his hands. &ldquo;I shall never forget the look on
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
that man&rsquo;s face, Longinus. Ever since that day I have been wondering
about him. The Jewish Messiah.&rdquo; He said it slowly, as
though he were talking more to himself than to his friend. &ldquo;Do
you remember that day on the &lsquo;Palmyra&rsquo; when we were talking
about this Yahweh of the Jews, this one-god spirit? You said then
that you would never be able to imagine a being without a body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember it quite clearly. But what are you going to
say,&rdquo; Longinus demanded, &ldquo;that this tall fellow might have been
a god turned into a man? By all the gods, Cornelius, you don&rsquo;t
mean to tell me you think this Galilean could be the Messiah of
the Jews? Their Messiah, if I understand it correctly, will be a
great military leader who will drive us pagan Romans out of Palestine
and re-establish the ancient Israelite kingdom. Even the Jews
don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;ll be a god, do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Longinus. I think most Jews believe he&rsquo;ll be a
great earthly king, as you say. But listening to that wild fellow
and seeing the look on that young man&rsquo;s face&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, then
ventured a hesitant grin&mdash;&ldquo;well, those strange words, the prophet&rsquo;s
evident sincerity, his intense manner....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jewish gibberish.&rdquo; Longinus shook his head and scowled. &ldquo;This
superstition has captured you, my friend. This eastern mysticism
that comes to a head in that cruel and extravagant circus down
there.&rdquo; He pointed toward the great Temple, whose gold-plated
roof shone brilliantly in the light of the moon now emerging from
behind a cloud. &ldquo;A carpenter from Galilee to overthrow imperial
Rome! What with, pray great Jove! A hammer and a chisel and a
flat-headed adz?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h2 id="c15">15</h2>
<p>For two days after his long meeting with the High Priest Caiaphas
and the former High Priest Annas, father-in-law of Caiaphas, the
Procurator Pontius Pilate was in a sullen mood. He said little and
kept close to his quarters in the Antonia Tower. Now and then
he would walk out onto the gallery overlooking the Temple enclosure
and, leaning upon the parapet, would stare balefully at the
magnificent structure and the stir of life within and around it.</p>
<p>The orderly movements of the priests, set through the long years
into an inexorable pattern as they followed the prescribed routine
of their duties, seemed almost to infuriate him. &ldquo;Look at them,
Centurion!&rdquo; he snapped to Longinus on one of these occasions
when the centurion happened to be sunning himself on the gallery.
&ldquo;See how smugly they go about their mummery, as if it were
the most important thing in the world. They seem studiously to
ignore our all-powerful Rome and lavish every attention upon their
Yahweh.&rdquo; He doubled his fist and banged it upon the parapet.
&ldquo;Yet one lone Roman century ordered into that hive of impudent,
arrogant busy bees could send them all flying, one Roman century,
Longinus. And by the great Jove, I&rsquo;m tempted to dispatch
soldiers down there to clean out that insubordinate, traitorous
nest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately, though, the Procurator issued no such order, and
the day passed without the Romans&rsquo; becoming involved in the
religious ceremonies of the Jews. The next morning, however,
Pilate called together all his officers on duty in Jerusalem, including
Longinus and Cornelius. Immediately it was evident that the
Procurator&rsquo;s hostility toward the Temple leadership had not diminished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in a war of wits with these obstinate, proud Jews,&rdquo; he
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
declared, &ldquo;and I cannot defeat them by remaining on the defensive.
It&rsquo;s been a war of words and gestures thus far, but I have
been forced to the opinion that we can have no victory over them
until we have had some blood.&rdquo; His blue eyes swept coldly over
the unsmiling faces before him. &ldquo;So I have determined upon a
bold plan in which we shall take the offensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate revealed that Caiaphas and Annas had rebuffed, though
with unctuous smiles and sugared words, his every effort even to
discuss the possibility of using Temple funds for the improvement
of Jerusalem, particularly the health of its residents, through the
construction of facilities to enlarge and improve the city&rsquo;s water
supply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They insist that this money has been dedicated to their god
and belongs to him and that for me to use one denarius of it, even
in promoting their welfare, would be a profanation and a sacrilege.
Old Annas, may Pluto burn him, even suggested that the people&mdash;he
emphasized the fact that he was not himself suggesting it&mdash;might
even believe that <i>I</i> had seized the money for my own use.&rdquo;
Pilate&rsquo;s anger had turned his face an ugly crimson. His voice rose
to a shout. &ldquo;A profanation indeed! To these insufferable Jews
everything they do not wish to do or to have done is a profanation.
Yet their priestly caste is sucking the very lifeblood of the
people in the name of religion.&rdquo; He paused for a moment, then
continued more calmly. &ldquo;So I have determined to initiate a bold
new plan. I shall have these Temple leaders crawling to me, and
on their bellies, cringing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When it was clear that Pilate had, at least temporarily, finished,
Sergius Paulus ventured to speak. &ldquo;But, Excellency, do you plan to
raid their Temple&rsquo;s treasury, to commandeer the gold the Jews
have stored there? Such a course, you must realize, might provoke
the wrath of the Emperor and the Prefect, since they have made
a compact with....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Commander, I am planning no raid on their treasury,&rdquo;
Pilate interrupted. &ldquo;On the contrary, they will bring their treasure
to me and urge me to use it in providing a new water supply for
Jerusalem. In so doing they will admit to me and, more importantly,
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
to their fellow religionists that Rome is master and that
their puny Yahweh is a lesser god than our Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly and more calmly the Procurator unfolded his plan.
When three days ago he had come into Jerusalem at the head of
the troops, he reminded them, he had suffered the humiliation,
for the first time in his military career, of marching with the proud
ensigns of Rome all sheathed. This was done, he pointed out, to
appease the Jews, to mollify their Yahweh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You recall the stony silence with which we were greeted,
even the hostile looks of the people peering from behind their
screens or down from their housetops; you remember the hatred
in their eyes as we crossed through the Temple court on our way
here, the taunting remarks flung at us. Rome has lost prestige
in Palestine. We must recover it, and this I am determined to do.&rdquo;
The trace of a malevolent smile spread across his round Roman
face. &ldquo;The Emperor must not be made to yield to Yahweh; our
eagles and our fasces must no longer be hidden from view as
though we were ashamed of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus was watching Sergius Paulus. He saw the commander&rsquo;s
face blanch, but Sergius said nothing. And Pilate continued outlining
his plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On top of this tower&rdquo;&mdash;Pilate pointed upward&mdash;&ldquo;is a perpetual
flame that burns while the vestments of the High Priest are held
safe here in Antonia. Rome therefore is providing and tending a
flame that, to my mind, is a memorial of Rome&rsquo;s yielding. No ensign
with the Roman eagle flies above the fortress or hangs from
its ramparts. A further testimony to our surrender to the stubborn
Jews and their jealous god.&rdquo; A humorless smile wrote thin lines
at the corners of his mouth. &ldquo;Of course I am telling you what
you who are stationed in Jerusalem already know. Perhaps to me
it is more galling because it is new.&rdquo; He paused, as if to consider
carefully his next words. &ldquo;Tomorrow, with Centurion Longinus
and his century escorting my party,&rdquo; he began again, &ldquo;I shall leave
Jerusalem on my return to Caesarea. Centurion Cornelius with
his century from Galilee will remain here until after my departure;
how long he will stay will be determined by the situation.&rdquo; His
thin smile blossomed into a baleful grin. &ldquo;During the night, after
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
I have left, the troops stationed here at Antonia will extinguish
the flame atop the tower and hang out from the ramparts the ensigns
of Rome, including the eagles, the fasces, and the likenesses
of the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Excellency&rdquo;&mdash;Sergius&rsquo; face was pale, and his expression
mirrored alarm&mdash;&ldquo;do you realize how this action will provoke the
Jews, how it will inflame them against us, lead perhaps even to
bloodshed...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fully realize that, Commander. That is why I am ordering
it. I wish to provoke them. It is only by provoking them that
we can demonstrate forcefully to them that Rome is master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, the Emperor and the Prefect....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not aware that since my arrival at Caesarea I represent
the Emperor and the Prefect Sejanus in Judaea?&rdquo; The words were
almost a snarl. &ldquo;If you wish to dispute my authority or my judgment....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do not, Excellency. The Procurator&rsquo;s commands to me
naturally will be carried out fully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected as much, Commander. You will have charge of our
forces in Jerusalem in carrying out my orders. If it comes to
bloodshed, do not hesitate to shed Jewish blood if the Jews assail
you; your only concern will be to prevent the shedding by them
of Roman blood. I am confident that they will yield before offering
violence to Rome; I think they haven&rsquo;t the courage to challenge
us. What they will do&rdquo;&mdash;his cold, calculating smile overspread
his florid face&mdash;&ldquo;is send their priests, including old Annas
no doubt, whining to me at Caesarea and imploring me to rescind
my orders. Then I will have a lever with which to move them.
And thereafter, you may be sure, the legionaries and their ensigns
will be respected by the Jews as they are respected by all other
conquered peoples. Our Emperor, as he rightfully should, will
then take his place, even in Jerusalem, above their vengeful and
jealous Yahweh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dismissed the group with instructions to begin at once
their preparations for putting his orders into effect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<h2 id="c16">16</h2>
<p>For five days the roads into Caesarea from Jerusalem and central
Judaea were clogged with a motley throng of Jews pushing relentlessly
toward the Procurator&rsquo;s Palace. Here and there in the
multitude rode a man or woman on a donkey, but countless hundreds
trudged on foot, dust-covered and weary in every bone
but more outraged in spirit.</p>
<p>Then the dam that was Caesarea&rsquo;s gates was inundated, and
the flood of disgruntled Jewry, sweating, travel-soiled, frightened
but still undaunted in its anger despite the long and tiresome
journey, poured through the city to fill its market squares and
surge upward toward Pilate&rsquo;s house. The angry flood had burst
upon the port city hardly two days behind the messengers sent by
Sergius Paulus to warn the Procurator of the multitude&rsquo;s approach.</p>
<p>The Jews, the messengers informed Pilate, were swarming toward
Caesarea to protest with all the vigor they could command
his profanation, they called it, of their holy city through the display
at the Tower of Antonia of the Roman army&rsquo;s ensigns, including
even the likenesses of the Emperor Tiberius. The morning
after the Procurator&rsquo;s departure, they revealed, the Jews had
awakened to behold with horror the flaunted banners. But their
vehement protests to the commander of the fortress had been
unavailing. Sergius Paulus had told them with firmness that only
a command of Pilate could restore the flame above the tower
and once again sheathe the offending ensigns.</p>
<p>So, alternately beating their breasts with loud lamentations and
angrily calling down their Yahweh&rsquo;s curses upon the invading
Edomites, as they termed the Romans, they had surged into the
roads and pushed northwestward to demand of the Procurator himself
an end to the profanation of their Jerusalem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Five days ago these Jews had arrived at Caesarea, but five days
of protesting, of threatening, of pleading, and of threatening again
had not moved Pontius Pilate. &ldquo;Rome is master,&rdquo; declared the
stubborn and proud Procurator to the Jews&rsquo; spokesmen; &ldquo;the emblems
of Rome&rsquo;s mastery will not be removed or sheathed. My
orders stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the sons of Israel, too, were unyielding in their demands.
&ldquo;Your Emperor Augustus, your Emperor Tiberius&rdquo;&mdash;Pilate took
notice that they did not say &ldquo;our&rdquo; Emperor&mdash;&ldquo;have respected our
laws, which forbid the display of such emblems, and have been
strict in honoring our religion,&rdquo; the spokesman insisted. &ldquo;Your
Emperor Tiberius cannot but be angered by the refusal of the
Procurator to respect in the same manner our ancient traditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home!&rdquo; Pilate ordered. &ldquo;Get you back to Jerusalem. I, not
you, speak for Tiberius. I was sent out by him to govern this
province, and by the great Jove, I will govern it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Jews did not go home. Hungry, discouraged, exhausted,
they were not defeated. They swarmed about Pilate&rsquo;s palace, they
fell in their tracks on the marble of the esplanades to sleep fitfully
when sheer exhaustion overtook them; they crowded the
market places, they slept in rich men&rsquo;s doorways. But they would
not turn their backs on Caesarea.</p>
<p>On the morning of the sixth day, Pilate called Longinus to the
Palace. &ldquo;Centurion,&rdquo; he said, his face livid with anger, &ldquo;since
Sergius Paulus continues at Jerusalem, I wish you to take command
of the troops here and put into execution the orders I am about
to give you. Send out couriers to summon these Jews to come
together in the Hippodrome; say that I will meet them there. In
the meantime, disguise a sufficient number of your soldiers and
place them about the amphitheater in advantageous positions so
that should disorder arise among the Jews, you will be ready
immediately to put it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia had been listening to her husband. &ldquo;But, Pilate, aren&rsquo;t
you creating a situation that will produce fighting between our
troops and these Jews?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if there is bloodshed?&rdquo; Pilate&rsquo;s eyes flashed sudden anger.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I been patient with these obstinate rebels? If they choose
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
to get themselves run through with swords, isn&rsquo;t it their own
doing?&rdquo; Then quickly he recovered his poise. &ldquo;Claudia,&rdquo; he said
quietly, &ldquo;I have given them every opportunity to return peaceably
to Jerusalem. Have I not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But you have not agreed to have the ensigns sheathed.
And until you do....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned upon her, his countenance flaming, his mood changed
completely. &ldquo;Do you stand with these stubborn provincials against
Rome? Are you with them, or are you with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you interrupted me, Procurator,&rdquo; Claudia&rsquo;s voice was as
cold as her smile, &ldquo;I was going to observe that in displaying the
army&rsquo;s emblems, you are really breaking a tradition, so far as I have
been able to understand it, and this tradition may very well be a
long-standing order of the Emperor and, indeed, of Augustus before
him. I care not a fig about these Jews. Nor do I care about their
High Priest or their Yahweh. I am concerned only with what
will be the attitude of the Emperor and the Prefect Sejanus toward
the Procurator as a result of this unprecedented breach of
the established order.&rdquo; She turned away, her head high. Pilate
seemed taken aback; he looked at her somewhat sheepishly and
licked his lips as though he were about to speak. But he said
nothing. Instead, he turned abruptly to Longinus. &ldquo;I take responsibility
for the orders I give,&rdquo; he said tersely. &ldquo;My orders to
you are unchanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus saluted, then without a word turned on his heel and
withdrew.</p>
<p>By early afternoon the great concourse had filled with excited,
chattering Jews. Their determined stand, they felt confident, had
defeated the Procurator; their reminder that the Emperors had
honored the Jews and their Yahweh and that Tiberius might not
approve a course taken in defiance of the long-established tradition
had frightened Pilate. He was calling them together, wasn&rsquo;t
he, to announce that he was withdrawing the hated emblems and
to ask them to return home victors?</p>
<p>But they had judged the Procurator wrongly. And they discovered
their mistake as soon as he began to address the throng
from his box high in the stands of the great oval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;For five days, and this is now the sixth, you have kept our
Caesarea in turmoil. You have been obstinate and insubordinate
and have shown little respect to the Procurator, who represents
the Emperor and in this province personifies the power and
majesty of the Empire. You have threatened him with reprisal,
saying that he has flouted the orders of our Emperor. You were
not only inhospitable in refusing to welcome the Procurator to
Jerusalem, you were actually hostile. In being hostile to us, you
have shown yourselves contemptuous of Rome and enemies of
our Empire; in being stubbornly hateful to me, you have shown
yourselves no friends of the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate paused, his face suffused with color as his anger grew
with his listing of their offenses. Then he stood back on his heels,
squared his shoulders, and held up his tightly clenched fist. &ldquo;Now
hear me, men of Judaea!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I have asked you to disperse
and return to your homes. Stubbornly you have refused to
heed my command. I am asking you again to abandon this unreasonable,
senseless, and ill-advised effort and get yourselves outside
the gates of Caesarea and on the roads that lead homeward.
Hear me, by great Jove! This is my last command to you.&rdquo; He
leveled a shaking forefinger toward the multitude. &ldquo;I have stationed
my soldiers in disguise among you, and they are heavily armed.
They have been instructed, upon my next command, to spring
upon you and run you through with their swords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in the vast oval of the colosseum not an Israelite moved to
obey him. Stolidly, calmly, they faced the Procurator; silence
was heavy upon the great throng.</p>
<p>Pilate&rsquo;s face was twisted with wrath. &ldquo;Then I must give the
order, men of Judaea?&rdquo; He shouted the question.</p>
<p>Not a man moved.</p>
<p>Then from the ranks nearest Pilate a man stepped forward a
pace and held up his hand to speak. By his dress it was evident
that he was one of the Temple leaders. &ldquo;O noble Procurator,&rdquo; he
said in a loud voice, &ldquo;though your soldiers run us through with
swords until each of us has perished, we cannot submit to the
profanation of God&rsquo;s holy Temple; we cannot countenance without
protest the treading into the dust of our God&rsquo;s commandments.
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
Before we agree to Rome&rsquo;s profanation of our holy places
and her flouting of our God&rsquo;s laws, O Procurator, we will bow
our necks to the Procurator&rsquo;s soldiers. We will die, and gladly,
for our God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Profanation! Profanation! All I hear is Rome&rsquo;s profanation of
your traditions. By all the gods, in every other land our Emperor
is honored, his banners and his emblems, his likenesses paraded
on our staffs, all these are hailed with shouts and acclamations!
And yet you Jews....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Pilate paused. The priestly leader who had just addressed
him had fallen on his face in the dust of the great stadium,
and beside him and behind him others now were prostrating
themselves. Within moments every Jew in the place was lying face
down upon the ground before the Procurator of Judaea. Mouth
open, eyes darting from one area of the great concourse to another,
aghast, Pilate stood silent. Then quietly he spoke to Longinus,
who was standing near him. &ldquo;Centurion, I cannot order men
on their faces ran through with swords. It would be massacre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would be, Excellency, on their faces or standing, since
they are defenseless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate turned back to face the prostrated multitude. &ldquo;Stand
on your feet!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;I shall withhold for the moment
at least my command to the soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word being said, without a change of countenance
even, the Jews rose to their feet and faced the Procurator. &ldquo;Now
send me your High Priest and his father-in-law the former High
Priest Annas,&rdquo; Pilate commanded. &ldquo;No harm will be done them;
this I swear by the great Jove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hours later Caiaphas and Annas returned from the conference
with the Procurator at the palace. Mounting the rostrum from
which Pilate had previously addressed them, Caiaphas held up his
hand for silence. &ldquo;Men of Israel, we have just concluded our
meeting with the Procurator Pilate,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;An agreement
has been reached. Now you may return in peace to your
homes. The offensive emblems of Rome, the Procurator has assured
us, will be removed so that they will no longer profane our
holy places. The God of Israel, He is One!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;The God of Israel, He is One!&rdquo; The multitude of suddenly
exultant Jews echoed his words in a great chorus, and a hosanna
of shouts swept wave upon wave across the immense arena. Then,
laughing and chattering, the people began pushing toward the
Hippodrome&rsquo;s exits.</p>
<p>And in all the throng not a man ventured to inquire of the
High Priest what the terms of the agreement with Pilate had
been.</p>
<h2 id="c17">17</h2>
<p>An hour before the &ldquo;Actium&rdquo; was to sail out of the harbor at
Caesarea on the return voyage to Rome, Centurion Longinus
went aboard and handed the captain a heavily sealed communication
addressed to the Prefect Sejanus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an army message of great importance,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;It must be delivered in person to the Prefect. He is expecting
it, and if it is not delivered immediately after the docking of
your ship, he will begin to inquire why he has not received it.&rdquo;
Actually, the centurion knew that Sejanus was not expecting a
message from him on the returning &ldquo;Actium,&rdquo; but telling the
captain so would insure the message&rsquo;s getting quickly into the
hands of the Prefect. The captain might well think that the
centurion&rsquo;s letter was in reply to a message brought him from
Sejanus by the Tetrarch Herod Antipas.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Actium&rdquo; two days before had brought the Tetrarch and
his new wife Herodias and her daughter Salome to Caesarea, and
from the wharf they had been escorted by Longinus and a detachment
of his century to the Procurator&rsquo;s Palace to be guests of
Pilate and Claudia while resting a few days after the long voyage
out from Rome. From Caesarea they planned a short visit to
Jerusalem, and then they would travel northward through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
Jordan Valley to the Tetrarch&rsquo;s gleaming white marble palace at
Tiberias.</p>
<p>It was when Longinus learned that the &ldquo;Actium&rdquo; would be
returning directly to Rome that he decided to dispatch a report
to the Prefect. The report related in considerable detail the events
of the Procurator&rsquo;s recent visit to Jerusalem, his flaunting, in disregard
of Sergius Paulus&rsquo; warning, of the cohort&rsquo;s banners from
the Antonia ramparts, the subsequent storming of Caesarea by
the irate Jews, and Pilate&rsquo;s yielding to them, after a conference
with Caiaphas and Annas. Longinus advanced no suggestion concerning
the probable terms of the agreement between the Procurator
and the Temple leaders. The centurion was confident,
however, that the astute and suspicious Sejanus would infer from
what he had left unwritten that Pilate had profited handsomely.
Longinus concluded the message with an avowal that the report
was factual and uncolored.</p>
<p>From the &ldquo;Actium&rdquo; Longinus returned to the headquarters of
the cohort and that evening was a guest, along with Sergius Paulus,
of the Procurator and his wife at a small, informal dinner honoring
the Tetrarch, his wife, and her daughter. When they had finished
the meal, Herodias and her hostess retired to Claudia&rsquo;s apartment,
and Salome went to her chamber. The four men remained reclining
at the table, where after a while, as they drank wine and
nibbled grapes and figs, the inhibitions of Pilate and Antipas,
each vain and domineering and jealous of the other&rsquo;s authority,
began slowly to disappear. Gently at first Antipas chided the Procurator
for his profanation of Jerusalem by flaunting the ensigns
of Imperial Rome from the Tower of Antonia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Profanation! Profanation! All I hear in this contentious province
is profanation. I am sick of the word.&rdquo; Pilate wiggled a forefinger
at the Tetrarch. &ldquo;Do you consider Rome&rsquo;s display of her
honored emblems profanation of Jerusalem and this province, I
ask you, Tetrarch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antipas studied the fig he held between finger and thumb.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t consider it profanation, nor do the Emperor and the
Prefect, but I do agree with the Emperor and the Prefect that it
is a wise course not to offend unnecessarily the people of Israel
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
who do so hold.&rdquo; It was a clever answer, and Antipas, knowing
it, pressed the point. &ldquo;It would be politic if the new Procurator
learned to uphold the traditions of this land,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;so
long, of course, as they do not seriously conflict with the interests
of the Empire and certainly&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;so long as the Emperor
and the Prefect uphold them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate was quick to strike back. &ldquo;I was sent out to this province
to rule it,&rdquo; he declared, his eyes flashing indignation. &ldquo;I was not
sent here to cower and truckle, to lower Rome&rsquo;s ensigns at the demands
of your obstinate, cantankerous Jews,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;I came
to rule....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you did lower Rome&rsquo;s ensigns when those obstinate&mdash;Jews
bared their necks to your swordsmen and refused to obey your
command to return home,&rdquo; Antipas interrupted. Then suddenly,
as though seeking a truce, he changed his tone. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t blame
you, Procurator. In fact, I admire you; you&rsquo;re a very intelligent
man. Living in this province must be trying to one who has never
lived here before, and of course it&rsquo;s unrewarding unless there are
... ah ... extra benefits, shall we say ... not provided by Rome.
And there is much gold in the Temple&rsquo;s coffers, I am told. It seems
that no matter how much is withdrawn, a great deal still remains
for the use of the Temple leaders, hmm?&rdquo; He smiled appreciatively.
&ldquo;And no doubt the Prefect will approve, too, provided....&rdquo;
Grinning, he left the observation unfinished. &ldquo;And with no Jewish
blood shed by your soldiers, there will be nothing to explain
to Tiberius, Excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate glared, mouth open. But he did not deny the Tetrarch&rsquo;s
thinly veiled charge. &ldquo;Profanations! Violated traditions!&rdquo; He hurled
across the room the grape he had selected from the silver dish
of piled fruit and pointed a quaking finger at the Tetrarch. &ldquo;And
how dare you, Antipas, speak of my violating the traditions and
offending the religion of the Jews, when you have just taken to
bed your brother&rsquo;s wife! Is that not a heinous offense for a Jew
himself...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency!&rdquo; Sergius Paulus, palpably fearful of what the exchange
might quickly be leading to, jumped to his feet. &ldquo;The hour
is growing late, and the Centurion Longinus and I must be getting
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
back to headquarters. Please excuse us, sir. We&rsquo;ve enjoyed
your hospitality, and we beg you to express our thanks to your
wife.&rdquo; He glanced toward Longinus, who nodded agreement. &ldquo;And
I thought, Excellency, that the Tetrarch perhaps might honor us
by going with us&mdash;we have a sedan chair at the door&mdash;to inspect
our cohort headquarters, should you, sir, be willing to excuse him.&rdquo;
He looked questioningly toward the Procurator and then the
Tetrarch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should the Tetrarch wish....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be happy to accompany you,&rdquo; Antipas interrupted.
Carefully he pulled the stem from the fig. &ldquo;It will be a change of
air.&rdquo; But he was smiling, and his manner was jovial; the tension
of the moment had been dispelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have finished with him, Sergius&rdquo;&mdash;Pilate had calmed,
too, and no rancor was revealed in his tone&mdash;&ldquo;have him brought
back, properly attended. He and the Tetrarchess are always welcome
at the Procurator&rsquo;s Palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Longinus knew, as the three prepared to leave the great
dining hall, that relations between the Tetrarch and the Procurator
were still strained; he suspected that they would remain
so. The temperaments of the two men, coupled with the situations
in which they had been placed, would demand it. In his own dealings
with them, in his observation and appraisal of them and their
activities, he told himself, he must bear this always in mind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lounging comfortably on Claudia&rsquo;s large couch,
pillows at their backs, the two women had been exchanging news
of their own activities since they had last seen one another in
Rome, and, more interesting to Claudia, Herodias had been revealing
tidbits of gossip involving the more lively set in the Empire&rsquo;s
capital city. But soon the discussion narrowed to their own
changed circumstances. Claudia was frank. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s just as I told
you it would be that day you came to return my call. I said marrying
Pilate would make no difference. Remember? Well, it hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
A cloud passed across her countenance. &ldquo;Of course, we will have
to be patient, though, and wait for things to work out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But until they do, must you never...?&rdquo; Herodias paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t that bad,&rdquo; Claudia hastened to reply, smiling.
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
&ldquo;We can see each other and we can be together ... more
and more hereafter, I hope. We have been together already, for
hours, in fact, both here at Caesarea and in Jerusalem at the
Herod&rsquo;s Palace, while Pilate conveniently, I do believe, busied himself
at the Antonia Tower.&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;Really, Herodias,
I don&rsquo;t know whether the man is stupid, quite wise, or just indifferent.
But whatever he is, his being the way he is will help
Longinus and me to arrange things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herodias&rsquo; large dark eyes were bright now with scheming. &ldquo;My
dear, you have never been in Galilee, have you? It&rsquo;s a beautiful
land, especially now that spring is beginning to break, so much
more interesting than this barren Judaea. We have so many flowers,
and willows and oleanders and bright-blooming shrubs along
the watercourses. I remember Galilee in the spring from my
childhood days and on occasional visits since. So&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes were
dancing now&mdash;&ldquo;you must go with us to Tiberias. We can contrive
to have Longinus escort us. And in the Palace there&rdquo;&mdash;her voice
dropped to an intimate whisper&mdash;&ldquo;you will have no one to disturb
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Antipas&rsquo; other wife? What would she say if I should go
with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> am the Tetrarchess of Galilee and Peraea,&rdquo; she said evenly.
&ldquo;As soon as we get there, Antipas is going to divorce her and send
her back to old Aretas.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c18">18</h2>
<p>Before they reached the bend in the road roughly paralleling the
Jordan, whose banks were beginning to color now with the awakening
of willows and oleanders to advancing spring, the Tetrarch
recognized the voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the beard of the venerable High Priest!&rdquo; Antipas exclaimed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the place where he was making his stand when I came
this way before, but it&rsquo;s the same fellow, that mad prophet of the
Wilderness. I&rsquo;d know his haranguing anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus was riding beside the Tetrarch. Herodias and Claudia,
with lively Salome a few paces back, were following in the narrow
column, and just behind them rode Neaera, Tullia, and several
other servants of the two households. Soldiers were in the vanguard
and at the rear.</p>
<p>Antipas turned to Longinus. &ldquo;Centurion, I wonder if we
shouldn&rsquo;t go another way and avoid encountering this fellow.
I&rsquo;d rather not see him or hear more of his ranting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>I</i> want to see him.&rdquo; Herodias had ridden abreast of the
Tetrarch. &ldquo;He must be the one I&rsquo;ve just been hearing so much
about in Jerusalem. Everybody was talking of his ability to sway
the multitudes and his fearlessness in denouncing the Temple
priests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s the one. But, my dear Herodias,&rdquo; the Tetrarch began
to protest, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s likely to say something that will offend you, too.
The fellow has no respect for the Tetrarch&rsquo;s office or authority
and no bridle on his loose tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the gods, then, that&rsquo;s all the more reason I want to hear
him.&rdquo; She laughed gaily, then quickly grew sober. &ldquo;And certainly
the Tetrarch should be concerned,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;if the man flouts
the Tetrarch&rsquo;s authority.&rdquo; She signaled to Longinus to resume the
march. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ride down and join his audience. After the boredom
of our journey, this should at least provide a diversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antipas shook his head grudgingly but offered no further protest.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll regret it as soon as she hears him, by the gods,&rdquo; he
muttered to the centurion as they started. &ldquo;But I warned her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the bottom of the slope the group dismounted, and on Longinus&rsquo;
summons, soldiers came up to hold the horses. The servants
remained behind with them except for Neaera and Tullia who
followed their mistresses as the Tetrarch&rsquo;s party quietly slipped
around a screening clump of willows to join the throng about the
gaunt and weathered speaker. To Antipas, John seemed little
changed since that day when they had come upon him at the ford
farther up the Jordan. His clothes looked the same; fleetingly the
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
Tetrarch wondered if the haircloth mantle had ever been cleaned
since he had last seen it.</p>
<p>Although the Tetrarch&rsquo;s group had slipped unobtrusively into
the rim of the crowd, Antipas was quickly recognized, and soon a
murmur moved through the multitude and heads began to nod
as intent black eyes shifted from the fiery prophet to study the
newly arrived ruler of Galilee and Peraea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s old Herod,&rdquo; Longinus heard a beak-nosed, thin Jew whisper
to the man beside him. &ldquo;And that woman, she must be the new
wife he&rsquo;s fetched from Rome, the one he took away from his
brother, and that must be the brother&rsquo;s daughter beside her.&rdquo;
Both men turned to stare, then smile. &ldquo;I wonder what John will
say to that!&rdquo; one said to the other as they turned back to peer
again at the thundering prophet.</p>
<p>John, too, had recognized the Tetrarch, Longinus was sure; yet
the prophet made no immediate reference to his presence. Instead,
he continued preaching on the necessity of repentance and on the
use of baptism as a sign of Yahweh&rsquo;s forgiveness. The man was a
powerful speaker; he had native ability, Longinus immediately perceived,
to command attention and sway his hearers. The crowd
listened, entranced, to his every word; now and then one would
step forward and, crying loudly in repentance, ask for baptism.</p>
<p>Sometimes a man would interrupt the prophet to seek an answer
to some deeply perplexing problem. But no one yet had spoken
openly of the Tetrarch&rsquo;s presence among them.</p>
<p>Then a tall, narrow-faced Jew, unkempt, ill-clothed, evidently
a man of the earth, stepped forward and held up his hand. &ldquo;This
repentance of which you speak,&rdquo; he questioned, &ldquo;is it necessary
for the rich man in the same manner as it is for the poor and
dispossessed, for the man of authority as well as for the servant?
I ask you, does the measuring rod measure the same for all men,
or is there one rule for one man and another rule for another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repentance is necessary for all men, my brother,&rdquo; John replied
calmly. &ldquo;The same measuring rod measures for both the
man of authority and the servant who serves him, for both the
rich man and the man of earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John paused. Then slowly his dark eyes moved from the face
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
of his questioner to that of the Tetrarch. &ldquo;The same measuring rod
measures for the Tetrarch of Galilee, my brother, that measures
for you, and it is the same for even the lowliest servant in that
iniquitous marble pile above the graveyard in Tiberias!&rdquo; The
prophet&rsquo;s eyes were blazing now, and he raised his gaunt, sun-bronzed
arm to point a lean forefinger directly at Herod Antipas.
&ldquo;Repent, O Tetrarch, repent!&rdquo; His voice was thunderous now,
and the finger darted forward like the tongue of a serpent. &ldquo;Repent
while yet there is time! Repent of the evil you have done,
and seek in true penitence the forgiveness of our God Whom you
have scorned and despised!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antipas stood silent and stared straight ahead, looking as though
suddenly he had been turned to stone. But Herodias, though
amazed, had not been rendered speechless by the torrent of the
prophet&rsquo;s denunciation. Calmly she turned to her husband. &ldquo;Do
you intend to stand here and allow this madman to vilify you?
Are you going to stand patiently while...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you! You evil woman!&rdquo; John&rsquo;s shout interrupted her. Now
the angry hand was pointed directly at her. &ldquo;You call me a madman,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Yes, I am a madman. I am a madman for our
God. And I call upon you, too, to repent. Repent before our God
turns His face from you forever. I call upon both you sinners to
fall on your faces and cry out to the God of Israel, imploring Him
for forgiveness.&rdquo; Then the prophet&rsquo;s stern eyes turned again toward
the Tetrarch. &ldquo;Herod, cast this foul woman from you! Have
you not stolen her away from the bed of your brother? You cannot
have her, O Tetrarch! Does not God&rsquo;s holy law forbid a man
from taking to bed the wife of his living brother in the flesh?
Adulterer! Repent! And you, evil woman, you adulteress&rdquo;&mdash;John&rsquo;s
eyes were fiery now with a wild zeal as he faced Herodias, whose
flushed cheeks and lips drawn into thin lines revealed her fury&mdash;&ldquo;neither
shall you have him! Get you back to the bed you have
deserted, if the husband you have abandoned has the grace to
forgive and receive you! O Tetrarch&rdquo;&mdash;John lifted his gaunt arms
toward the heavens&mdash;&ldquo;cast her from you before your grievous sinning
brings ruin down upon the land. Send her back to your
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
brother, and humbly beseech the forgiveness of our God! Repent,
O Tetrarch, repent! Repent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Herod Antipas stood staring, unmoving, rooted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the great and little gods, Antipas&rdquo;&mdash;Herodias, infuriated,
whirled upon the Tetrarch, grabbed his arm and shook him&mdash;&ldquo;will
you stand there like a statue and permit that fanatic to insult
and intimidate you and your wife before this crowd?&rdquo; Scornfully
she measured him, and her lips curled with disgust. &ldquo;Are you
indeed the Tetrarch of Galilee, or are you a frightened mouse?&rdquo;
She stood back, taunting him with her shrill laugh.</p>
<p>Her challenging words and her mirthless laughter broke the
spell the prophet had cast. &ldquo;No, I am not afraid of him,&rdquo; Antipas
replied slowly, as though he were arguing with himself. &ldquo;Nor can
I any longer permit this abuse to go unpunished. He has not
only vilified your Tetrarch and his wife&rdquo;&mdash;Antipas was now addressing
the crowd rather than Herodias&mdash;&ldquo;but he has challenged
my honor and authority. His words are a call to insurrection. I
can no longer permit the preaching of rebellion.&rdquo; He turned to
confront Longinus. &ldquo;Centurion, arrest this man. Have him taken
at once to the Fortress Machaerus and there placed in its dungeon.
Order him held until I pronounce judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without even a glance toward the now silent but calm and
seemingly untroubled prophet of the Wilderness, Herod turned
and started along the gentle rise toward the horses.</p>
<h2 id="c19">19</h2>
<p>As they approached the southern shore line of the Sea of Galilee,
Longinus sent riders ahead to notify Chuza of the impending
arrival of the Tetrarch and his party at Tiberias. So the steward,
with household servants to handle the baggage, was waiting at the
palace gate when the caravan entered the grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>But Chuza, though he greeted them warmly and with profuse
smiles, was obviously troubled, and Antipas quickly drew the
man aside to question him. &ldquo;Sire, you will not find the Tetrarchess
here to welcome you,&rdquo; the steward explained, his tone apologetic
and his expression patently pained. &ldquo;She has departed from
Tiberias. I suggested that she might wish to delay her leaving,
Sire, until your return, but she insisted on going at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had received a message, she told Chuza, that her father,
King Aretas of Arabia Petraea, was desperately ill and that he had
summoned her to his bedside. Although the steward had seen no
messengers, he had not been disposed to question the Tetrarchess.
She had prepared for the journey very quickly. The Centurion
Cornelius had provided her with a detachment of soldiers to escort
her to her father&rsquo;s capital in the country southeast of the Dead Sea,
beyond the Fortress Machaerus; she had taken with her, in addition,
her best raiment and many of her choicest personal possessions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think that she is not planning to come back to me?
Is that what you&rsquo;re suggesting, Chuza?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire, I am suggesting nothing. I am relating only what I
saw and heard. I have no opinion as to what plans the Tetrarchess....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Princess Herodias is Tetrarchess now, Chuza,&rdquo; Antipas
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Sire&rdquo;&mdash;Chuza bowed to the Tetrarch and then to
Herodias&mdash;&ldquo;the former Tetrarchess....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when did she depart, Chuza?&rdquo; Antipas interrupted again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week ago, Sire. The escorting soldiers have not yet returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had she heard that I was returning from Rome with a new
Tetrarchess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said nothing to me about it, Sire, but I am confident that
she knew of the Tetrarch&rsquo;s marriage. Passengers coming ashore at
Ptolema&iuml;s from the vessel on which you and the Tetrarchess sailed
out from Rome brought to Tiberias word of the new Tetrarchess.
I myself heard it, and surely the report must have come also to
her ears here at the palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Chuza; think no more of it.&rdquo; By now they had
entered the lofty, marble-columned great atrium. A faint smile
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
crossed his heavy face. &ldquo;Do you know, I believe she must have
suspected all along?&rdquo; He turned to Herodias. &ldquo;By all the gods, my
dear, she has made our course all the easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus declined the invitation of the Tetrarch and Herodias
to take a chamber in the palace during his stay at Tiberias. He
had promised Cornelius that he would be his guest when next he
came to Galilee. Tempting though the Tetrarch&rsquo;s invitation had
been, Longinus reasoned that it might be wise to assume that the
watched might also be the watching.</p>
<p>Besides, Claudia had been assigned an apartment which, the
centurion had observed, looked out upon a broad terrace facing
the Sea of Galilee. A door from Claudia&rsquo;s bedroom conveniently
opened onto the terrace. Longinus smiled as he reviewed the details
of the arrangement.</p>
<p>The sentry at the palace gate, he also knew, would be a Roman
soldier.</p>
<h2 id="c20">20</h2>
<p>Cornelius shook his head solemnly. &ldquo;Herod will regret it. Arresting
the prophet was unwise, Longinus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the fellow is an insurrectionist, Cornelius; certainly it
can&rsquo;t be denied that he&rsquo;s been inciting rebellion against the
Tetrarch&rsquo;s rule. You should have heard what he called Antipas
and Herodias.&rdquo; A wry smile twisted the corners of his mouth.
&ldquo;Of course, just between you and me, I think he was right. But
that doesn&rsquo;t absolve him from agitating against the Tetrarch, and
in this province, of course, the Tetrarch represents Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think that the prophet&rsquo;s a revolutionary,&rdquo; Cornelius
insisted. &ldquo;He lambasted the Tetrarch that day we came on him at
Bethabara, too, but he wasn&rsquo;t challenging Herod&rsquo;s authority as
Tetrarch; he was denouncing his wickedness as a man and calling
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
upon him as a man to repent just as others were repenting. There&rsquo;s
a difference, Longinus, even though it&rsquo;s hard for us Romans to
understand that. We bundle our religion&mdash;if we have any, which
few of us do, I suspect&mdash;and our imperial government into one
packet. But the Jews keep their religion and their government, or
rather our enforced government over them, separate. And their religion
is predominant. In ordering John imprisoned, therefore,
Herod is allowing the government to invade the Jews&rsquo; religious
precincts, just as Pilate did when he had the army&rsquo;s ensigns flown
from the ramparts of Antonia. He&rsquo;s likely to find himself in the
same sort of situation that Pilate faced. It will do him no good;
John at Machaerus will likely have more power over the people
than he would have had if Herod had left him unmolested.&rdquo; He
glanced quizzically toward his friend. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never thought of it. Nor do I care, by the gods, what becomes
of that Wilderness fellow, or....&rdquo; He paused and glanced
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one to hear us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was there. From the early evening meal, eaten in the stuffiness
of the garrison&rsquo;s mess hall at a table with the other officers,
Cornelius had brought his guest to the flat roof. Up here they
would escape the heat and the heavy odors of food and wine and
sweating soldiers and at the same time catch any vagrant breeze
that might be stirring from the sea. Nor would there be any ears
to overhear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to say that I cared little what happened to him
or Antipas ... or, by great Jove, even Pontius Pilate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both Herod and Pilate have blundered. And I&rsquo;m sure Sejanus
will be hearing about it; that is, if he hasn&rsquo;t heard of it already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus nodded, then casually changed the subject. &ldquo;By the
way,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;that reminds me; what ever became of
that carpenter you said the desert preacher hailed as the Jews&rsquo;
Messiah? Has he begun yet the task of wrecking the Roman Empire
with his hammer and chisels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just possible that he has, though not with any hammer and
chisel.&rdquo; His smile was enigmatic. &ldquo;Certainly the Empire, if I
understand him, isn&rsquo;t built on any plan that he approves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;By all the gods, Cornelius!&rdquo; Longinus, who had been sprawled
in his chair with his feet propped on the low rampart, sat up with
a start. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius held up his hand. &ldquo;Now wait,&rdquo; he said calmly.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be alarmed about. You won&rsquo;t need to report
to Sejanus about the carpenter. But since I saw you last he has
gained a great following, even among some of the more influential
people. You remember that beautiful woman Herod took with him
to Jerusalem, the one called Mary of Magdala?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could forget her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree. Well, she&rsquo;s a disciple of the carpenter now, and a
different woman, they say; she&rsquo;s forsworn the Tetrarch&rsquo;s bedchamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe&rdquo;&mdash;Longinus grinned&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s because Herodias has
moved in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be; I don&rsquo;t know. But the report is that she&rsquo;s given up
all her amatory pursuits in order to follow him. All up and down
the seaside, in fact, the people are swarming to hear him and beseech
his help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But insurrection, Cornelius....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t that, Longinus. The Galilean isn&rsquo;t concerned with
the government, as I understand his teachings, though I&rsquo;ve seen
little of him myself; I get my information from some of the Jews
in the synagogue at Capernaum&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;who secretly, I
suspect, are followers of the man, though many others among
the Jews are hostile. I think he wants to change people as individuals,
not their governments; he wants to help them. I&rsquo;m sure
he&rsquo;s never given any thought to fomenting rebellion against Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus relaxed and sat back. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s just another of these
religious fanatics, isn&rsquo;t he? Well, I&rsquo;m relieved to hear that, though
Palestine seems to have more than its share of these charlatans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlatan? I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. Let me tell you a story, and
then you can deduce what you wish. It happened only a few
weeks ago. When you see Chuza, Herod&rsquo;s steward....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you see him again, ask him to tell you what happened
to his son. Everybody in this part of the country has heard about
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
it; the news swept through Galilee like flames across a parched
grassland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, by the gods, Cornelius, what did happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chuza&rsquo;s young son had come down with a fever. In this low
country along the lakeside, you know, fevers are pretty common,
but they&rsquo;re not often dangerous. So Chuza and Joanna&mdash;she&rsquo;s his
wife&mdash;weren&rsquo;t alarmed at first. But when days passed and the boy
didn&rsquo;t improve&mdash;in fact, his condition grew worse&mdash;they became
concerned. One physician after another was called in, and they
exhausted all the treatments they knew how to give. But the
child was failing fast, and Chuza and Joanna were frantic; it looked
as though their son wouldn&rsquo;t live much longer. The fever was
consuming him. What could they do? Where could they get help?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened that on the last day, when it appeared that the
boy was about to die, a Jewish fisherman who had occasionally
been supplying the palace came to Chuza. He and his brother
and two other brothers with whom he frequently fished had made
a heavy catch, and this Simon had come to inquire if Chuza
would buy a mess for the Tetrarch&rsquo;s household.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a servant came to the door and told him his master could
not discuss business; the steward&rsquo;s son, he explained, was dying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In that case, I must see him,&rsquo; the fisherman said to the servant.
&lsquo;I can tell him how his son&rsquo;s life may be saved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the servant told him that the physicians had despaired
of saving the child and that the parents were momentarily awaiting
his death. He ordered Simon to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fisherman, a headstrong fellow, insisted, however, on being
shown into the chamberlain&rsquo;s presence, and the argument grew
so loud that Chuza heard and came out to discover what was taking
place. The fisherman Simon then told the Tetrarch&rsquo;s steward
of the Galilean carpenter&rsquo;s amazing ability to effect miraculous
cures, and he suggested that a servant be sent on horseback to find
this young man, whom Simon referred to as &lsquo;the Master.&rsquo; &lsquo;And
when the servant finds him,&rsquo; he said &lsquo;have him bring the Master
here, and he will heal your son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course Chuza protested,&rdquo; Cornelius continued, &ldquo;that skilled
physicians had been unable to cure the child. &lsquo;Only try the Master,&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
Simon then implored him. &lsquo;Only have faith in him and ask him
to heal your son, and he will heal him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suddenly the thought came to Chuza that surely he had
nothing to lose by seeking out the Galilean mystic. The child was
already on the verge of death; certainly this Jesus ben Joseph,
whatever he might do, wouldn&rsquo;t further endanger the boy&rsquo;s life.
So he asked Simon where his master might be found and whether
he would come at once to his son&rsquo;s bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Galilean was visiting friends at Cana, a village a few miles
west of the little sea. And Simon assured Chuza that he would
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Chuza decided to seek the carpenter&rsquo;s aid. But he sent no
servant for him. Instead, he had three horses saddled, one for
Simon, one for himself, and one for this Jesus ben Joseph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As we rode westward toward Cana,&rsquo; Chuza told me, &lsquo;I felt
a growing hope that the strange Galilean might really be able to
restore my son to health, and I was possessed by an overpowering
urge to find the man. Soon Simon and I were racing along the
dusty road. When we reached Cana and found the house, we discovered
this Jesus seated with his friends at the noonday meal.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius got up from his chair, sat down again on the rampart,
and looked out toward a small fleet of fishing boats coming in to
shore with the day&rsquo;s catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the gods,&rdquo; Longinus asked, &ldquo;what happened then? Go on;
it&rsquo;s a good story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he looked into the understanding eyes of the young
man from Nazareth, Chuza told me, a strange warmth, not physical
warmth from the hard riding but a sense of eased tension, of
peace, perhaps, something he said he couldn&rsquo;t describe to me and
didn&rsquo;t entirely understand himself, took possession of him. He
knew then, he was utterly certain, he said, that the young man
smiling at him had the power to heal his son, if he could but get
him to Tiberias in time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more Cornelius paused in his recital to study a fishing
boat unloading a heavy catch. Then he resumed the narrative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chuza said he didn&rsquo;t remember what he said to the man, except
that he blurted out his plea for help and begged the stranger
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
to return with him to the boy&rsquo;s bedside. He and his wife loved their
son so much, he pleaded, and the little fellow was dying. If only
the carpenter would intervene to save him, he knew the child&rsquo;s life
would be spared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Cornelius went on, &ldquo;the Nazareth carpenter said a
strange thing. He turned his intent, kindly gaze from Chuza to
glance at those at the table with him. &lsquo;Always you must have
signs and wonders,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you believe without actually
seeing these things done before your eyes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chuza didn&rsquo;t understand the man&rsquo;s words, but he didn&rsquo;t try
to find out what they meant. His son was dying, his need was
desperate. Once more he begged the carpenter for his help. &lsquo;O,
sir, my boy is dying,&rsquo; he pleaded; &lsquo;he won&rsquo;t last out the day unless
you go to him. Won&rsquo;t you leave with us now, sir, and restore
him?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius paused again. Longinus, his forehead creased in heavy
concentration, seemed absorbed in the doings of several fishermen
down at the water&rsquo;s edge as they struggled with a heavy net. But
he turned quickly to confront his friend. &ldquo;Pluto blast you, Cornelius!
Why do you keep stopping? Did the carpenter return with
him or didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t. He laid his hand on Chuza&rsquo;s shoulder. &lsquo;Return
to your son,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The fever has left him. He has been restored.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose when Chuza and the fisherman got back, they
found that the boy&rsquo;s fever had actually broken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was fully recovered. And when Chuza asked Joanna
what time it was when the fever broke, she said it was the seventh
hour, which was exactly when the carpenter had told Chuza that
the boy had been restored.&rdquo; Cornelius smiled and stood up.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the story, Centurion ... Chuza&rsquo;s story, not mine. What
do you make of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good story, and ably told by you. I&rsquo;d call it an entertaining
account of a remarkable coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a coincidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else could it be? Surely you don&rsquo;t believe that this carpenter
fellow, without even going to the sick boy, drove out the
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
fever? You know that fever victims either get well or die and that
once the fever reaches a certain point, it goes one way or the
other; it&rsquo;s either death or a very rapid recovery, and the odds are
about the same.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;After hearing
Chuza&rsquo;s story the carpenter probably calculated it was time for
the fever to break, and he simply gambled on the outcome.&rdquo; Then
he was suddenly serious, his eyes questioning. &ldquo;Cornelius, don&rsquo;t
tell me you believe the carpenter actually cured the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Longinus. But I&rsquo;ll say this: I don&rsquo;t disbelieve
it. And I do know that the boy is alive and well today.&rdquo; Cornelius
stood up and stretched. &ldquo;After all, to Chuza and Joanna that&rsquo;s
the important thing. When you see Chuza, you might ask him
what he thinks of the Galilean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that carpenter did cure the boy in the manner you described,
Cornelius, then he&rsquo;s bound to be a god. And would a carpenter be
a god, and a Galilean carpenter, at that? To me the whole idea
is preposterous. But I&rsquo;m just a Roman soldier; I haven&rsquo;t been
exposed, like you, to these eastern workers of magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Jesus is no magician. In fact, he seems reluctant to perform
these&mdash;what did he call them&mdash;&lsquo;signs and wonders.&rsquo; But the
sick and the crippled continually besiege him to heal them, and
his sympathies for the unfortunate appear to be boundless.&rdquo;
Cornelius sat down again on the parapet. &ldquo;Tell me, do you remember
that day we were sailing down the Tiber, standing at the
&lsquo;Palmyra&rsquo;s&rsquo; rail talking about the various gods, and you said that
you could never comprehend a spirit god, something that was
nothing, you said, a being without a body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I still feel that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about a god that does have a body, a god-man? If a
god should have a physical body and be in every physical respect
like a man, would that make sense to you? Could you comprehend
such a god?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, Cornelius, you&rsquo;ve been out here with these Jews for
much too long. You&rsquo;ve been listening to too much prattle about
their Yahweh. A god without a body, a body that houses a god.
Bah! I put no credence in any of these notions. As for that carpenter,
I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s another Wilderness preacher, not as fanatical perhaps,
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
not as desert-parched and smelling of dried sweat as John,
but certainly no god&mdash;whatever a god is, if there is such a thing,
which I most seriously doubt. A carpenter from Nazareth, that hillside
cluster of huts! Cornelius, I&rsquo;ve been to Nazareth, as I&rsquo;m sure
you have. I ask you, would a god choose Nazareth to come from?&rdquo;
He stood up. &ldquo;Nevertheless, the story you told was entertaining.
Maybe to some it would be convincing. To me, though....&rdquo; He
shook his head slowly. Then suddenly a wide grin lighted his grim
countenance. &ldquo;How is it that you and I inevitably get around
sooner or later to a discussion of the gods? And where do we invariably
end? Nowhere. Talk, that&rsquo;s all. And talk is all it can ever
be, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s all too nebulous, intangible....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Longinus, if this all-powerful, all-wise, all-good god that
old Pheidias envisioned, this supreme one god, in order to communicate
with his earthly creatures&rdquo;&mdash;Cornelius held up his hand
to stop Longinus, who had been about to interrupt&mdash;&ldquo;should decide
to take the form of a man, an ordinary man....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the small and great gods,&rdquo; Longinus did interrupt, &ldquo;do
you think then that he would choose to be a carpenter from
Nazareth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius stared at the fishing boats, now pulled up on the
beach; the lengthening shadows had already begun to obscure
them. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<h2 id="c21">21</h2>
<p>Herod Antipas was in a bad mood; he said little and appeared
preoccupied during the meal. When they had finished he announced
that he planned to spend the remainder of the evening
conferring with his ministers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been out of the country for
a long time,&rdquo; he explained casually. &ldquo;I suspect there will be many
trying problems awaiting consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>When the Tetrarch withdrew from the lofty dining chamber,
Herodias had servants place couches at the eastern edge of the
terrace beside the bordering balustrade of faintly rose-hued marble,
and with Neaera and Tullia hovering discreetly near them, the
new Tetrarchess and her guest lay back comfortably to relax after
the heavy meal. Out here it was cooler than it had been in the
great chamber, for the white marble palace of Herod Antipas had
been built on an upflung spit of land that pushed out like a flattened
giant thumb into the Sea of Galilee, and whenever there
was a breeze from off the water it swept unobstructed across the
spacious terrace.</p>
<p>This terrace had been built seaward from an immense glass-covered
peristylium, paved with tiny marble blocks in colors
that had been laid to form an intricate but pleasing mosaic pattern
and alive with fountains, flowers, and luxuriant tropical plants.
Predominantly Roman in architecture, decoration, and furnishings,
the palace reminded Claudia of the Procurator&rsquo;s Palace at
Caesarea. &ldquo;Except that it&rsquo;s more pretentious,&rdquo; she told Herodias.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; Herodias agreed. &ldquo;Antipas was determined for once
to outdo his father. He had always lived in the shadow of old
Herod, and I think he resented it. But even so, he has never
had the ambition or the courage that his father had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely, Herodias, you don&rsquo;t see any virtue in your grandfather.
Didn&rsquo;t he have your grandmother and your father killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and my father&rsquo;s brother Alexander. No, he was a monster,
particularly in his last years when I think he must have been demented.
But he was an able man, and he had courage. He never
would have permitted that desert fellow to stand there and insult
him and his wife, for example, even if the man had had all the
Jews in Galilee at his side. Nor would he have yielded, as your
Pilate did, to those Jews at Caesarea. He would have had them
run through with swords and would have roared with laughter at
their agonized dying. But perhaps I offend you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t offend me, my dear. Nor do I defend Pilate.
But you must remember, he has Sejanus to deal with and also
my beloved stepfather. Neither of those pillars of the Empire
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
would have sanctioned the massacre of thousands of Jews. Pilate
does have a difficult role to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herodias smiled and pointed a ringed forefinger. &ldquo;And are you
going to help him play it, my dear Claudia, or will you...?&rdquo; She
paused and allowed her question to hang in mid-air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or will I conspire with Longinus to lead Pilate into making
further wrong moves, thereby getting him recalled and perhaps
banished and permitting me to divorce him and marry Longinus?&rdquo;
Laughing, Claudia sat up and swung her feet to the floor. &ldquo;You
are so subtle, my dear, so very subtle.&rdquo; Now she shook an accusing
finger at her hostess. &ldquo;But tell me, what will you do when
Aretas&rsquo; daughter returns to Tiberias and demands her place as
Tetrarchess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t return; Antipas is sending her a bill of divorcement.
Surely you must know that I would see to that. In fact, I think
she left with her mind made up that she was finished as Tetrarchess.
My only thought&mdash;and that isn&rsquo;t concern&mdash;is what old Aretas
will do about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behind them now the lamps had been lighted in the palace.
A brilliant full moon slowly climbed the sky above the little sea;
both women lay back luxuriously to watch the moon mount
higher, and before long their talk had slowed into silence. Suddenly
Herodias realized that she had become almost senseless. She
sat up with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the gods, Claudia, we&rsquo;re almost asleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re tired from the journey,&rdquo; Claudia said, rubbing her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Maybe we should go to bed. Can I have Neaera bring
you something? Some wine and wafers, fruit, or a glass of hot
milk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a thing. I&rsquo;m still stuffed from the wonderful dinner.
I only want to get to bed and to sleep. I am really quite tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be indeed.&rdquo; Her smile, Claudia saw plainly in the
brightness of the full moon, was positively devilish. It was impossible
to mistake its meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; she laughed, then added, &ldquo;but surely you heard him
tell the Tetrarch he would spend the night with Cornelius?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard him tell the Tetrarch.&rdquo; She stood up. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
to bed.&rdquo; They crossed the terrace and entered the palace. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
you to your chamber,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>An inner room that opened into Claudia&rsquo;s had been prepared
for Tullia. Herodias glanced quickly around the apartment, then
turned to go. At the door opening onto the corridor she paused.
&ldquo;I hope you will be comfortable and sleep well.&rdquo; Her eyes brightened.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be disturbed. And you&rsquo;ll discover&rdquo;&mdash;she swept
her hand in an arc to embrace Claudia&rsquo;s chamber&mdash;&ldquo;that all your
doors have bolts opening from the inside, including,&rdquo; she added
with a knowing smile, &ldquo;the one to the terrace. Good night,
Claudia. And, by all the gods&rdquo;&mdash;her dark, wanton eyes had burst
into dancing flames&mdash;&ldquo;I envy you!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c22">22</h2>
<p>Claudia sat up in bed, instantly and fully awake. She knew that
she had been dreaming, a confused, wandering, disconnected,
senseless sort of dream, though now with her awakening it had
vanished completely, dissolved into nothing. But the gentle tapping
that had been mixed with the dreaming, had not been a part
of it; the tapping at the door to the terrace was real and repeated
and insistent.</p>
<p>She kicked her feet free of the sheet and swung them to the
floor. From the waist down, as she arose, she stood in the narrow
band of silver-cold moonlight spearing through the tall window
behind her to cut diagonally across the foot of the bed; quickly she
stepped into the less revealing shadows at the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longinus?&rdquo; she whispered, her face close to the panel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One minute until I can draw the bolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was inside and she was closing and bolting the door,
he slipped his toga off and, stepping past the shaft of moonlight,
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
dropped it on a chair against the wall near the head of the bed.
As he turned around, she came toward him, her arms outstretched;
crossing the bright beam, her white body stood plainly revealed
through the sheerness of the black gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Longinus&rdquo;&mdash;she flung herself into his arms&mdash;&ldquo;I thought
you really had decided to stay with Cornelius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted her to her toes and held her, almost crushingly,
against him, and then he caught her chin and raising her face so
that he could look into her eyes, bent down and kissed her red and
warmly eager lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; he asked when he released her after a long
while, &ldquo;that those words were for Antipas and not you? Didn&rsquo;t
you know that nothing could possibly keep me from you tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gently, almost carrying her, he led her the two or three steps
to the bed. They sat down beside each other, and he bent forward
to unbuckle his sandals. When he sat up again, she twisted her
feet around and lifted them to the bed, doubled up her knees, and
lay with her head and right shoulder pressed hard against his
side. &ldquo;Are you tired from the journey and anxious to get to sleep?&rdquo;
she asked, turning her head to look into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired maybe, and warm from walking from the Antonia&rdquo;&mdash;he
pulled his tunic open at the throat and to his waist&mdash;&ldquo;but sleepy,
no.&rdquo; He laughed, but not loudly, for the palace was as quiet as a
sepulcher. &ldquo;Do you think any man in my present situation could
be sleepy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, by all the gods, I know one.&rdquo; She sat up and swung
her feet to the floor. &ldquo;Pontius Pilate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Claudia, he couldn&rsquo;t be that cold-blooded.&rdquo; He pulled her
to him, and drew her warm body into the closing circle of his
arms. She lifted her feet again to the bed and slid down into the
brightness of the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, I tell you he is, Longinus. All the man ever thinks of is
guarding and extending the powers and authority of the Procuratorship
and piling up Jewish shekels. To him my only attraction
is being the Emperor&rsquo;s stepdaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s an even bigger fool than I thought.&rdquo; Gently he
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
pushed her chin down to pull her lips slightly apart and, bending
over her, crushed his mouth upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Longinus,&rdquo; she cried out, when finally, breathing heavily,
he raised his head, &ldquo;do take me away from him! Do, Longinus,
oh, do, do! I cannot endure him! By all the gods, I simply cannot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where would we go?&rdquo; He looked deeply into her troubled
eyes, luminous even in the shadows. &ldquo;How could we escape the
Emperor and the Prefect, my dear girl? How could we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t, of course. If we attempted it, they would soon
find us, and Tiberius would do to you what my grandfather did
to my poor father. I know that, Longinus. But it&rsquo;s so long from
one time with you to another, from one night so quickly passed
to the gods only know when again.&rdquo; She slipped her hand beneath
his tunic and caressingly ran her fingers across the damp,
warm expanse of his chest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard waiting for these few
stolen hours,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Must we be forever waiting, Longinus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Claudia, no. Pluto burn him! One of these days he&rsquo;ll go
too far with the Emperor and Sejanus. But we&rsquo;ve got to give
him time to be caught in his own trap. Then when he&rsquo;s ruined
himself, the Emperor will permit you to divorce him. But in the
meantime, we must steal all the hours we can&rdquo;&mdash;his words were
blurred as he buried his face in her lustrous, fragrant hair&mdash;&ldquo;and
not be too concerned with Pilate or our future.&rdquo; They remained
silent side by side for a while, then Longinus raised his head.
Claudia lay stretched out full length upon the bed, and from
the waist down now her scarcely concealed body came within the
rapidly widening band of moonlight. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t try to anticipate
things,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;We must seize the opportunities
as they come. Carpe diem, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; He bent lower to look into
her eyes. &ldquo;More to the point, let&rsquo;s enjoy the night while we
have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up quickly and in the shadows hastily stripped off his
clothes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<h2 id="c23">23</h2>
<p>As he drifted up slowly out of the depths of slumber he fancied
he was hearing the early cockcrow from Castra Praetoria; surely
he was sharing Claudia&rsquo;s bed in her apartment in the Imperial
Palace, for he could smell her perfume, he could feel the satiny
texture of her hair spread fan-like across his chest.</p>
<p>The trumpet was insistent. He would have to open his eyes. He
twisted up on his elbow and squinted toward the window; light
sifting into the chamber revealed the crumpled sheer nightgown
dropped across his clothes on the chair near the bed. Looking
down, he studied Claudia&rsquo;s sleeping face&mdash;rouge-smeared, half-open
mouth, cheeks, forehead, and even her neck splotched with the
smudged prints of his lips from her own lipstick.</p>
<p>He glanced around the room again; no, this time he was not in
Rome, and the trumpet call came only from the post headquarters
in Tiberias. This time there was no threat of immediate separation.
Immensely relieved, he pulled up the sheet that had fallen
away and snuggled back down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you be going so soon?&rdquo; she asked sleepily, for his movement
had aroused her. &ldquo;Must you always be leaving me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the cockcrow at Castra Praetoria, and I have early duty,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Maybe this morning I&rsquo;ll be summoned before the Prefect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t deceiving me. The Prefect is in Rome, and we are
in Tiberias,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;And you have no morning duty at the
post&rsquo;s quarters.&rdquo; Smiling, she added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that sleepy, Centurion.&rdquo;
She slid forward and sat up, then just as quickly slipped
back beneath the protecting sheet. &ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; she said, grinning.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m so glad that you don&rsquo;t have to leave now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll have to be going soon,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get
away before the palace is too much astir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why, Longinus? Must you sneak away as though you were
a thieving intruder? Don&rsquo;t you know that Herodias was expecting
you? She even admitted that she was envious of me; I&rsquo;m sure she
was anticipating a far less interesting evening with Antipas.&rdquo; She
paused, and her eyes widened. &ldquo;Surely you aren&rsquo;t afraid of his
knowing ... about us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not afraid of the Tetrarch&rsquo;s knowing&rdquo;&mdash;his tone
was gently scolding&mdash;&ldquo;or, by the gods, of Pontius Pilate&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then could it be Cornelius?&rdquo; Now she was teasing. &ldquo;But
doesn&rsquo;t he know? Surely....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;He knew last night I was coming
here. He gave me the password for the sentry at the palace gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did he know you were going to be spending the night ...
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell him that. But I&rsquo;m sure that anybody with the intelligence
of a centurion would arrive at such a conclusion.&rdquo; He
was grinning. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But maybe he doesn&rsquo;t approve, now that he&rsquo;s become so
interested in the Jews&rsquo; religion. And judging by that desert fanatic&rsquo;s
tirade against Herodias and Antipas, even the most innocent
adultery is frowned upon by these Jewish religionists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever he may think about it, Cornelius knows very well
that what you and I do is none of his business, and I&rsquo;m sure he
won&rsquo;t try to make it his affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m the one.&rdquo; Her smeared lips were pushed out in a
feigned pout. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bored with me. I know, you&rsquo;re just trying
to get rid....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly girl.&rdquo; He pulled her close, for she had coquettishly twisted
away. &ldquo;Did I say I was leaving right now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c24">24</h2>
<p>Two soldiers from his own century at Caesarea who had ridden
into Tiberias during the night were awaiting Longinus when he
returned to the garrison headquarters. They had been sent by
Sergius Paulus with a message from the Prefect Sejanus. A note
from the Prefect had been attached to the carefully sealed message,
emphasizing the importance of the communication and ordering
Sergius Paulus, should Longinus not be in Caesarea on its arrival,
to have it dispatched to him wherever he might be and as speedily
as possible.</p>
<p>The message from Sejanus had arrived on an Alexandrian grain
ship that had sailed into the harbor at Caesarea several days after
Herod Antipas and his new wife, with their party and their guest,
the Procurator&rsquo;s wife, had departed for Jerusalem on their way to
Tiberias. The cohort commander had dispatched the two horsemen
at once in the hope that they might overtake the centurion
before Herod&rsquo;s party had started on the journey up the Jordan
Valley toward the Galilean capital. But the caravan had been two
days on the way before the horseman rode into Jerusalem; from
there they had started almost immediately for Tiberias.</p>
<p>Quickly and with considerable apprehension Longinus broke the
seals. Why was the message so urgent? What could have happened?
He knew that Sejanus was not replying to the report he
himself had dispatched to the Prefect by the hand of the &ldquo;Actium&rsquo;s&rdquo;
captain; that vessel had probably not even reached Rome
yet.</p>
<p>Longinus hurriedly scanned the message; then, relieved, he read
it again more slowly. The Prefect was summoning him to return
to Rome to report in detail on the situation in Judaea and Galilee.
But first he was to go immediately to Senator Piso&rsquo;s glassworks in
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
Phoenicia. There he would receive a package which he would then
convey to Rome.</p>
<p>The package would be highly valuable, the Prefect warned; it
would contain a large sum of money, revenue from sales of glassware,
and he was to exercise every precaution in seeing to it that
he got it to Rome intact. Impress as many soldiers as he thought
necessary to serve as guards while the package was being transported
from the glass plant to the ship that would bring it to
Rome, the Prefect ordered; take no risk of being waylaid by robbers
or some band of zealots. He suggested that to minimize this
danger, the centurion should go aboard ship at Tyre, the seaport
nearest the plant.</p>
<p>Longinus explained to the two soldiers who had brought him
the message that he was being ordered to Rome by the Prefect
Sejanus and instructed them to bear to Sergius Paulus a message
he would write. In this note he informed the cohort commander
of the assignment Sejanus had given him to come to Rome, although
he made no mention of the money he would be delivering.
He added that the Prefect had given him no details of the new
assignment; he would write later from Rome. When he finished
writing the communication, Longinus dismissed the two to return
with it to Caesarea.</p>
<p>Cornelius had been aware of the arrival of the two men sent by
Sergius Paulus; Longinus told him what the Prefect&rsquo;s instructions
had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cornelius, I want you to pick a small detachment from your
century to go with me to Phoenicia for the package and then on
over to Tyre,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If by any chance I should let that money
be stolen....&rdquo; He shrugged and drew his fingers across his
throat. &ldquo;I suspect a large portion of it, if not all, is destined to
find its way into the Prefect&rsquo;s private coffers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius agreed to accompany him. His men would leave early
on the morrow and meet the two centurions at the home of
Cornelius at Capernaum where they would spend the evening.
From there the party would start northwestward for the senator&rsquo;s
glassworks in Phoenicia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Cornelius when they had made the arrangements,
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be wanting to return to the palace; after today it
may be a long time before you see Claudia again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only last night he and Claudia had talked of how they might
remain in Tiberias for perhaps two weeks; he had even considered
taking her with him on a hurried visit to the glassworks, which
he had not inspected for the last several months. And they would
manage to spend every evening together, to be with each other
every night through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Longinus, let me go with you to Rome! Take me, please,&rdquo;
she pleaded an hour later as they sat on the terrace outside her
bedchamber. &ldquo;Do you dare, Longinus? Or, should I say, do we
dare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;though by all the gods, I wish we did.&rdquo; He
shook his head slowly. &ldquo;No, Claudia, we mustn&rsquo;t attempt it. You
might be able to hide from the Prefect and the Emperor. But not
for long. Pilate would report your disappearance&mdash;he would have
to for his own protection&mdash;and immediately Sejanus would suspect
me. He might even think you and I were plotting to upset the
rule of Tiberius, which would mean, of course, the overthrow of
the Prefect. You would be discovered within a matter of days. And
then in all probability it would be the imperial headsman for me,
and for you ... well, for you it would probably be a fate much
like your mother&rsquo;s, Pandateria or some other far-off place. And for
the friends who tried to hide you, death, too. You see, Sejanus
and the Emperor married you off to Pilate to get you far away
from Rome. They intend for you to remain away. Until&rdquo;&mdash;he
shrugged&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a violent change in Rome, you must not return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat quietly and looked out at the fishing boats plying the
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t remain long in Rome, I think,&rdquo; he said after a while.
&ldquo;If the gods are good, Claudia, it will be only a few months
until....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the gods are good!&rdquo; she interrupted, harshly. &ldquo;There are no
good gods, Longinus. There are no gods!&rdquo; She scowled and looked
away. &ldquo;If there are, how can they be so perverse?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dispute it. Call it what you like, gods, fate, chance,
luck....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill luck, perversity of fate. Bona Dea, Longinus, if there are
gods, they are evil, and the most evil of all is old Sejanus, may
Pluto transfix him with his white-hot fork! Why must he forever
be doing us ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, who knows, he may be serving us well in calling me
to Rome. It may lead to the Emperor&rsquo;s banishing Pilate or, if not
that, his removal from the Procuratorship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the gods grant it!&rdquo; she said fervently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, my dear&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;there are no gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat for a long time on the sunlit terrace and talked, though
they knew their future was a difficult one to predict. They walked
down to the beach and strolled along the sands; once they paused
to sit for a while on the rotting hull of a half-buried fishing boat.
Before the sun dropped westward behind the palace they climbed
the steps and crossed the esplanade; in the peristylium he said
good-by to the Tetrarch and Herodias. Claudia walked with him
back to the terrace, where he quickly bade her farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you before many months in Caesarea,&rdquo; he said and
gently pinched her cheek. He bent down for a last kiss. &ldquo;Pray the
gods for the winds to bring me quickly ... and with good news.
Pray the silly little no-gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would, if I thought it would bring you back any sooner,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d even say a prayer&mdash;and offer a lamb&mdash;to the Jew&rsquo;s grim
Yahweh. But I have more faith in the charity of the winds themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later he and Cornelius set out for Capernaum. The
squad from the Tiberias century that would escort them to the
glassworks and then to the harbor at Tyre had been selected and
equipped for the journey; the soldiers would join the centurions
the next morning at the home of Cornelius.</p>
<p>As they were nearing the house, Cornelius turned to question
his friend. &ldquo;Longinus, do you remember Lucian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucian? Your son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you could probably call him our son, although he&rsquo;s actually
my slave. He was given me by his father, just before he
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
died, when Lucian was only three or four years old. He&rsquo;s the
grandson of old Pheidias, the tutor I was telling you about some
time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do remember the boy. But he is more like a son than a
slave, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is. We&rsquo;re devoted to the boy. We couldn&rsquo;t love him more,
I&rsquo;m sure, nor could he love us more, if he were really our own
flesh and blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why are you asking me about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, some time ago I promised Lucian that the next time I
went on a journey I&rsquo;d take him along. I wonder if you would object
to his going with us up into Phoenicia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Why don&rsquo;t you take him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall. We&rsquo;ll get an early start in the morning. We
ought to be ready to begin the journey when the detachment arrives
from Tiberias.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the next morning Lucian was ill. Perhaps, Cornelius
thought, it came from the great excitement of the anticipated
journey. With his palm the centurion felt the boy&rsquo;s forehead,
cheeks, under his chin. They were feverish.</p>
<h2 title=""><span class="sc">Phoenicia</span></h2>
<div class="img">

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<h2 id="c25">25</h2>
<p>The old man, smoke-blackened and naked except for a frayed and
soiled loincloth, tottered forward and collapsed at their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He almost fell into the fire chamber,&rdquo; explained one of the two
young slaves who had dragged him from the furnace shed.</p>
<p>A beetle-browed, scowling overseer with a long leather whip
came running from an adjacent section of the sheds. &ldquo;Get back
to your work!&rdquo; he shouted, as he slashed viciously at the slaves.
The two fled inside; the burly fellow strode across to the old man
on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water! O Zeus, mercy. Water! Water!&rdquo; the old slave gasped.</p>
<p>The overseer raised his whip. &ldquo;Stand up, you, or by the gods,
I&rsquo;ll cut you in strips!&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Get back to the furnace!&rdquo; He
stood poised to strike the inert man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; Cornelius commanded. &ldquo;Strike him once, and by the
great Jove, you&rsquo;ll have me to deal with!&rdquo; Suddenly furious, his
eyes blazing, the centurion stepped forward to confront the overseer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, by the gods, are you?&rdquo; the fellow demanded insolently.
&ldquo;By whose authority do you interfere with the operation of this
plant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the great gods, my own, if the centurion&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced
coldly toward Longinus&mdash;&ldquo;is little enough interested to stop you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch him!&rdquo; Longinus pointed. &ldquo;And get back to your
duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rdquo;&mdash;the fellow was glowering, his heavy jaw thrust
out&mdash;&ldquo;are you, by the gods, to be giving me orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aroused by the angry words outside the fire chamber, a man
rushed from the near-by furnace-shed office. &ldquo;Porcius, you insolent,
blundering fool, put down that whip!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
know the centurion&rdquo;&mdash;he gestured toward Longinus&mdash;&ldquo;is the son
of Senator Piso, who owns this plant? And the other one is his
friend. Now you get back to your work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first let him get this poor old slave some water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Centurion.&rdquo; He turned fiercely to the overseer. &ldquo;You heard
the centurion. Go! And bring a cloth, too, to bathe his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Zeus, mercy. Water.&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s plea was hardly a whisper.
&ldquo;Mercy, O....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus pointed. &ldquo;Water will do him no good now, Cornelius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wizened, gaunt slave&rsquo;s eyes, wide-open, were setting in an
agonized, frightened stare; his head was stretched back, and Cornelius,
looking into his blackened and bony face, saw that it was
pitted and scarred from innumerable small burns; the eyebrows
and eyelashes were completely gone, singed away in the intolerable
heat of the glass furnaces.</p>
<p>The overseer returned with the water and a smudged cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need now,&rdquo; the plant superintendent said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The overseer nodded. &ldquo;Shall we....?&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;The usual
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the moment. Put him over there under the shed.
Later, when....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we have left, eh?&rdquo; Cornelius was pointedly sarcastic.
&ldquo;What is the usual way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superintendent hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him, Lucius,&rdquo; Longinus spoke out unconcernedly.
&ldquo;Usually, Cornelius, they are thrown into the furnaces they have
been tending, provided, of course, that the heat is so intense that
such disposition of the cadaver will not endanger the mixture in
the glassmaking. Oftentimes they end up over there, in the deserted
area behind that sand dune, with the vultures picking their
ill-padded bones. But every now and then, when they do drag one
over there, particularly if the breeze is from the land, they shovel
a bit of sand over him.&rdquo; He shrugged and thrust out his hands
solemnly. &ldquo;Of course, doing it that way provides a more pleasant
atmosphere for working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius appeared not to have heard his friend&rsquo;s poor attempt
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
at humor. He stared at the dead slave on the ground and slowly
shook his head. &ldquo;He was calling upon Zeus, a Greek. He might
have been another Pheidias.&rdquo; He shook his head ruefully. &ldquo;Slaves
both, but what a difference in their lots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the difference?&rdquo; Longinus demanded. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
both dead. Your old tutor was put away honorably in a tomb, no
doubt. But when this fellow&rsquo;s carcass has become a handful of
ashes or is completely dissolved into the sand and water and sea
winds, won&rsquo;t they both be gone to nothingness, ended without a
trace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re both dead, yes. But gone to nothingness, I can&rsquo;t say.
It might be that their spirits, their souls....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Cornelius.&rdquo; Longinus turned to the plant superintendent,
&ldquo;My friend has been too long in Palestine,&rdquo; he commented
wryly. &ldquo;He has come to believe what those Jews believe,
that the death of a man is not his end. In other words&rdquo;&mdash;he
pointed to the stiffened slave now being borne to the shed&mdash;&ldquo;that
that fellow&rsquo;s soul, whatever a soul is&mdash;if there is such a thing,
which I find it impossible to believe&mdash;is floating around somewhere
in a world filled with other disembodied beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will excuse me, sir,&rdquo; the manager said, evading comment,
&ldquo;I have some work....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Lucius. We will be leaving early tomorrow for Tyre.
Everything, you say, is ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything, the reports, the revenue, everything, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier Longinus had shown Cornelius through the various departments
of the glassmaking plant, and Cornelius had marveled
at the skill of the glassblowers, slaves whose lot was incomparably
more fortunate, he saw, than that of those who fired the roaring
furnaces. When he had remarked about this to Longinus, his
host had observed casually that the blowers were valuable property,
while the laborers in the furnace chambers were easily replaced
when after a few weeks or months they literally burned
themselves out. The two had just completed their tour when the
old Greek was dragged out to die before them.</p>
<p>From the plant they strolled toward the beach some two hundred
paces below it. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get that slave out of my mind,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
Cornelius said, as they sat in the bow of a small boat that had
been pulled up on the sands. &ldquo;By all the gods, I thought those
on the docks of the Emporium were having a hard time, but
these slaves that fire your glass furnaces&rdquo;&mdash;he grimaced&mdash;&ldquo;Jupiter
pity them. Certainly nobody else does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we are to have beautiful glass in the mansions of Rome,
or at the Tetrarch&rsquo;s Palace, or the Procurator&rsquo;s at Caesarea, or in
countless other great places of the wealthy and the privileged, if
revenue from the glass factories is to continue flowing into the
coffers of the Empire and the Prefect, then, Cornelius, the furnaces
must be stoked and the molten glass must be blown. So&rdquo;&mdash;he
shrugged&mdash;&ldquo;slaves will die and be replaced. But remember,
Cornelius, they are slaves, and slaves are easy to come by; fresh
ones are always being sent out here by Sejanus. And we only put
those of least value into the furnace chambers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Longinus, the value of a slave is to be measured in direct
proportion to the value of the merchandise&mdash;in your case, glassware&mdash;he
is able to produce? And when tomorrow you leave for Rome
with the profits made from your glassware, you will be carrying the
lives of many slaves in your package, won&rsquo;t you? And when at the
markets of Rome and Antioch and Alexandria you sell those beautiful
goblets with their slender, rose-tinted stems, you will know
that you are selling glass colored with the lifeblood of men such
as that old Greek, that slave who perhaps by now has been consumed
in the very furnace that exacted his life? Isn&rsquo;t that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cornelius, you&rsquo;re a good soldier, but you&rsquo;re in the wrong profession.&rdquo;
Longinus leaned forward and cracked his bronzed
knuckles. &ldquo;You should be writing poetry or lecturing classes in
philosophy, or even&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, and a grin spread across his
face&mdash;&ldquo;be acting as a priest in the Temple at Jerusalem.&rdquo; Suddenly
the smile was gone. &ldquo;Of course a slave is valuable in proportion
to what he can produce or the service he can provide.
Aren&rsquo;t we all valuable in that same proportion? We live awhile,
work, love, hate, die. What do we leave? Only what we have produced.
Everything else is gone, including us. So, in the end, we
and the dead slave are the same ... nothing. But you don&rsquo;t
agree, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to agree, Longinus. What you say makes sense.
But something within me says just as emphatically that you are
wrong. Yet I can&rsquo;t prove it.&rdquo; Cornelius dug his sandaled heels
into the sand at the bottom of the long abandoned boat. &ldquo;I keep
thinking of the old Greek up there. I don&rsquo;t know what life gave
him, of course, before some invading Roman soldiers destroyed
his home&mdash;if he had a home&mdash;certainly his way of life, and dragged
him to Rome, where he simply had the bad luck to fall into the
hands of the Prefect. But there&rsquo;s no mystery about what life has
offered him since his enslavement. And this man may have been
another Pheidias, Centurion, a man more intelligent, more cultured,
a better man, my friend, than nine out of ten of the equestrians
in Rome. Obviously, then, life has been unfair to him. And
you say he is finished, done for, nothing. You say there will never
be any chance of his getting a better throw of the dice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And throw of the dice is right, too. He shook them in
the cup and rolled them, and they rolled wrong; we rolled ours,
and they stopped with the right numbers up. That&rsquo;s all there is
to it. Fate, chance, luck, call it what you will. It&rsquo;s a few years or
many, a good life or one of pain ... and then nothing. Isn&rsquo;t it
just that simple, Cornelius? How else could it possibly be? Isn&rsquo;t
any other idea simply superstition?&rdquo; Longinus leaned over and
picked up a small shell. &ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What happened
to the mollusk who lived here? Did he live out his span of life happily,
or was he eaten in his prime? And is his unshelled spirit now
swimming about in some sea heaven?&rdquo; He tossed the shell into
the surf. &ldquo;That old slave up there, I maintain, is just as dead and
gone&mdash;or will be when his corpse is disposed of&mdash;as the mollusk
who once inhabited that shell. And both of them are gone for
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you put men and mollusks in the same category?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as far as having immortal spirits is concerned. But you
don&rsquo;t, Centurion; you hold with your Pharisee friends&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
Pharisees who believe in immortality, isn&rsquo;t it&mdash;that man is a
different sort of animal in that he survives in a spirit world....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to; I want to. It&rsquo;s a damnably unfair world if he
doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s just as unfair if he does. Look.&rdquo; Longinus leaned forward
again. &ldquo;You say that this all-powerful, all-wise, all-good god,
this Yahweh, will see to it that in the next world, the spirit world,
that old slave up there will get justice. But I insist that such a
god does not exist; if he did, as I argued that day we were sailing
down the Tiber, you remember, he wouldn&rsquo;t permit such unfairness
and injustice in this present life. Isn&rsquo;t that a logical contention,
Cornelius? How can a good god, I ask you again, decree,
or permit, so much evil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Cornelius replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no nearer an answer
to your question now than I was that other day. But I am confident
that if this god exists&mdash;and I believe he does, Longinus; in fact
I&rsquo;m even stronger now in that belief than I was then&mdash;he does not
decree evil, he simply permits evil men sometimes to rule in the
affairs of this earthly, physical life. It may be that he doesn&rsquo;t want
to restrict man&rsquo;s freedom. Do you see? That wouldn&rsquo;t mean he
approves of the evil acts of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus slowly shook his head. &ldquo;No, Cornelius, I don&rsquo;t see.
Your argument seems completely fatuous to me. I cannot comprehend
an all-powerful, good god who would permit men to do one
another evil. I am convinced that the fact that the world is filled
with men who are unjust and cruel and evil indisputably proves
that no such god exists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I would answer that it is strong evidence but not indisputable
proof.&rdquo; For a long moment Cornelius stared out in the
direction of a merchant ship sailing southward toward towering
Mount Carmel. &ldquo;You see, Longinus,&rdquo; he said, turning to face his
companion, &ldquo;we have so little information on which to base an
opinion. If there is such a god&mdash;if there is, remember&mdash;how can
we even comprehend his nature, what he is like, unless?...&rdquo; He
paused and looked back to the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless someone reveals him to us, interprets him to men,
shows his works and thoughts....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jewish Messiah, eh? The carpenter who is about to overthrow
Rome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ever indicated that he was seeking to overthrow
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
Rome. I think that idea has come down from the old
Jewish prophets, who foresaw a great political and military savior
of their land. Several times I&rsquo;ve been in the crowds listening to
him talking, and so far as I could tell, he was only trying to explain
to the people the nature of this god whom he refers to as
his father. He was attempting to interpret this Yahweh to them
sometimes even to the extent of utilizing some of this father god&rsquo;s
power. That&rsquo;s apparently what he did when he restored Chuza&rsquo;s
son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he was clever enough to figure out when nature
would do the restoring. But we won&rsquo;t go into that again.&rdquo; Longinus
twisted around in the boat and stood up. &ldquo;No, my friend,
I insist that your reasoning is not sound, that you have been overcome
by this eastern mysticism which seems to fill the very air
out here.&rdquo; He clapped his hand on Cornelius&rsquo; shoulder; his friend
had risen with him. &ldquo;Centurion, come with me to Rome; I suspect
that you need to be indoctrinated again in the ways of modern
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could go with you.&rdquo; Cornelius stepped from the boat
and kicked the sand from his sandals. &ldquo;But sometimes I wonder
just what sort of thinking could properly be termed modern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked back to the inn to await the loading of the ship
on which Longinus would sail for the capital. No further mention
was made of the Roman gods, the Greek gods, Yahweh, or the
Galilean carpenter. And early in the forenoon the next day the
vessel spread its sails for Rome. Two hours later Cornelius and his
men started on their return to Tiberias.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<h2 id="c26">26</h2>
<p>One of the household servants was waiting for Cornelius when
he returned to the garrison&rsquo;s quarters at Tiberias.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Centurion, Lucian is desperately ill,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;In the last
few days he has developed a palsy. Your wife bade me tell you that
she fears him near death. You must come back with me, sir; she&rsquo;s
greatly frightened and in much distress about the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the physicians? Haven&rsquo;t they been able to help him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shook his head. &ldquo;She has had them all with him, sir,
all she could find in this region, and they have done what they
could; but the paralysis has spread, and his fever does not abate.
All their efforts have been useless. She prays that you hurry, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As fast as their horses could take them the two raced toward
Capernaum. When Cornelius entered the house, his wife rushed
to him and fell into his arms. &ldquo;Oh, I thought you would never
get here,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Lucian is near death, I know; I don&rsquo;t see how
he can live much longer. And the physicians have despaired of
saving him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there must be something we can do,&rdquo; he said, as he turned
toward the sick boy&rsquo;s chamber. &ldquo;Are there no other physicians we
could call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And the paralysis seems to be growing worse.
He is deathly ill, Cornelius. Oh, by all the gods, if there were
something....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By all the gods.&rsquo; The carpenter! Didn&rsquo;t he restore Chuza&rsquo;s
son? And though Lucian is a slave, isn&rsquo;t he just as much a son to
us? Wouldn&rsquo;t the carpenter just as willingly restore a slave boy,
even of a Roman soldier?&rdquo; He had said the words aloud, but they
had been addressed more to himself than to his wife.</p>
<p>He turned smiling, to face her. &ldquo;Do you remember how that
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
young carpenter of Nazareth healed the son of Herod&rsquo;s chamberlain?
Don&rsquo;t you think...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s a Jew, Cornelius, and we are Romans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter.&rdquo; He turned to the servant who had gone to Tiberias
in search of him. &ldquo;Get me a fresh horse, and quickly!&rdquo; he ordered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out to find that carpenter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later he stopped to inquire of a shopkeeper if
the man had seen the young Nazarene rabbi. &ldquo;Has he been around
today?&rdquo; Cornelius asked. &ldquo;Can you tell me how to find him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He passed here this morning,&rdquo; the shopkeeper answered, &ldquo;with
Simon and the Zebedees and some of those others who are usually
with him. They went out the gate in the western wall, and
judging by the poor trade I&rsquo;ve had all day, the whole city&rsquo;s gone
out after them. I hear the carpenter&rsquo;s been speaking to them from
the side of that little mountain over there.&rdquo; With his head he
motioned toward the west. &ldquo;In all likelihood you&rsquo;ll find him
there, soldier.&rdquo; Suddenly his face fell; his hands shook as he
grasped his scraggly beard. &ldquo;Now wait a minute,&rdquo; he sputtered,
&ldquo;this fellow, this Nazarene, he hasn&rsquo;t run afoul of you Romans,
has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. No, indeed. It&rsquo;s on a personal mission that I seek him.&rdquo;
Cornelius smiled reassuringly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m his friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shopkeeper looked relieved. &ldquo;Then if you station yourself
at the western gate, you&rsquo;ll surely see him as he returns to the city.
Or you might ride out toward the mountain, soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius rode on through the gate. He was halfway to the little
eminence in the plain west of the city when he began to meet the
throng returning. Soon he spotted the rabbi walking in the company
of the Capernaum fishermen. Boldly he rode up to them and
dismounted.</p>
<p>The men with Jesus formed a circle about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am unarmed, and I intend no one harm,&rdquo; Cornelius said,
holding out his hands. &ldquo;I am seeking the rabbi of Nazareth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus stepped forward and held up his staff in salute. His brown
eyes were warmly bright. Cornelius, closer to him than he had
ever been before, saw sparkling in the beads of perspiration rolling
down his bronzed smooth forehead the long rays of the setting
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
sun. He saw them, too, in the beads clinging to the thick mat of
reddish-brown hair on the carpenter&rsquo;s chest, for in the sultry stillness
of the dying day, Jesus had thrown open his robe half way
to his rope-belted waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have of me, my brother?&rdquo; he asked the centurion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I pray you to restore my little servant boy whom I greatly
love; I fear he is near death of a palsy. If, sir, you would but say
the word....&rdquo; He paused, suddenly hesitant.</p>
<p>The rabbi reached out and with strong brown fingers grasped
the centurion&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I will go with you and restore the boy,&rdquo; he
said gently. &ldquo;Show me to your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, I am a Roman soldier&rdquo;&mdash;a feeling of embarrassment,
deep humility, strange to the centurion, possessed him as he looked
into the face of the young rabbi&mdash;&ldquo;and unworthy that you should
enter my house. But if you would only command that my little
servant boy be healed, while we stand here, sir, then I know that
he would be restored to health.&rdquo; He smiled, weakly, he thought.
&ldquo;You see, sir, I understand authority, for I am a centurion and
when I give a command, it is obeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant the rabbi said nothing, but his warm eyes lighted
with a rapture plain to see. He turned to his friends. &ldquo;Nowhere
in Israel have I seen such faith. I tell you that many will come
from the east and the west and with our fathers Abraham and
Isaac and Jacob sit down in the Kingdom of Heaven. But many
of the chosen likewise will be cast out, and there will be great
wailing and mourning, for their faith shall not be as the faith of
this Roman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned again to confront the centurion, and Cornelius
saw that his face was radiant. &ldquo;You may go on your way, my
brother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As you have believed that it might be done,
so has it been accomplished. Return in peace to the little boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir....&rdquo; But the centurion&rsquo;s eyes were blinded with tears,
and he bowed his head, and no words would come. Then he felt
a warm hand on his shoulder and strong fingers once more gently
squeezing his arm, then the fingers released it. When after a moment
he looked up, Cornelius saw that the Nazarene and his
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
friends had resumed walking toward the city gate. In that same
instant Jesus turned and looked over his shoulder, his face still
alight with a glowing happiness, and raised his hand high in a
parting salute. Then he quickly turned eastward again, and the
little group disappeared around the bend.</p>
<p>Cornelius stood unmoving, his left hand still clutching the
bridle rein, and then he mounted and rode toward the western
gate. A few paces ahead he went around the bend and shortly
passed the rabbi and his friends, who had overtaken several men
who evidently had been out with them at the mountainside; Jesus
smiled and once more lifted his hand in friendly greeting.</p>
<p>The centurion, reaching the gate, rode through it and toward
the center of the city, where he turned left and followed a cavernous
road to the gate in the southern wall. He was in no hurry as
his horse picked its way along the cobblestones and out upon
the coast road southward. His fright, his sudden hysteria had gone;
it had vanished completely as he had looked into the eyes of the
young rabbi. Cornelius knew that Lucian would be well; not the
shadow of a doubt darkened his thoughts.</p>
<p>When he reached home and turned into his courtyard, a servant
came running to take his horse. &ldquo;Lucian, sir, is well again!&rdquo;
the man declared, almost breathless with the excitement of being
the first to give his master the thrilling news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it.&rdquo; Cornelius smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, it was only an hour ago that....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man over at Capernaum told me then,&rdquo; he said and strode
toward the house as the servant, mouth open, stared after him.</p>
<p>As he stepped inside from the courtyard, his wife, who had
heard him ride in from the roadway, rushed to him and flung her
aims about his waist. &ldquo;Oh, Cornelius, Lucian has been restored!
Not only has his fever gone, but so has the paralysis. He can use
his arms and hands, and he can walk as though nothing had ever
been wrong with his legs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood back from him, her eyes wet with the sudden surging
of her emotion. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful, Cornelius! And it happened
so quickly, too; he was low, Cornelius, desperately sick, much
sicker than when you left, I&rsquo;m sure, and the fever was consuming
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
him. I had turned aside from his bed a moment to wet a cloth
to spread on his forehead; then, as I wrung it out and turned back
to him, suddenly he sat up. I caught him under his arms and
discovered that he was no longer feverish; in a moment he was
talking and using his hands, and then quickly he stood up and
walked toward the table where I had set the pitcher of cool water.
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m so thirsty,&rsquo; he said, grinning at me, &lsquo;and hungry, too.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew about it. It happened about an hour ago. Where
is Lucian now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went out to the stables. He wanted to see his horse; he
hadn&rsquo;t....&rdquo; Abruptly she broke off and stared at her husband,
incredulous. &ldquo;Cornelius, how did you know when it happened?
Did one of the servants tell...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when I rode in a moment ago. But I knew when it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how, Cornelius?&rdquo; Her amazement was evident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten that I went in search of the carpenter of
Nazareth? Well, an hour ago I came upon him beyond the western
gate of Capernaum. I implored him to heal Lucian, and he did.
He told me so. And I knew he had; I had not the slightest doubt.
Nor am I in the least surprised to find him well.&rdquo; His serious
expression relaxed into a warm smile. &ldquo;Did you feed the young
imp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And he was famished. Literally, Cornelius, the boy ate
like a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he hadn&rsquo;t had anything in days; he was bound to be
empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Cornelius, this carpenter from Nazareth....&rdquo; She paused,
her forehead furrowed in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, not waiting for her to finish her question, &ldquo;and,
by all the gods, I&rsquo;d like to see Longinus try to explain this one
away!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 title=""><span class="sc">Rome</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/rose.jpg" alt="decorative glyph" width="78" height="77" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c27">27</h2>
<p>When the vessel eased in to dock just below the Sublicious Bridge,
almost at the spot from which the &ldquo;Palmyra&rdquo; had started its voyage,
Longinus went ashore. Quickly he engaged a loitering freed
slave to help with his luggage. He had brought little from Phoenicia,
only his clothing and a few small presents for his mother,
principally some choice pieces of glass, and the package he was delivering
to Sejanus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry this,&rdquo; he said to the fellow; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s glass and fragile.&rdquo;
He picked up the bundle, heavily wrapped. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll take this
spare toga, too. You can carry the remainder. I don&rsquo;t want any
sedan chair; I&rsquo;d rather walk. I want to get my land legs back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The toga had been wrapped about the money packet, which
Longinus had kept securely under his arm as he descended from
the ship. But it was an innocent looking bundle and only its
weight would have excited a bearer&rsquo;s suspicion. Longinus had determined
not to let it get out of his possession until he had locked
it in his father&rsquo;s safe to await its delivery to the Prefect.</p>
<p>They walked from the pier along the way that went eastward
from the bridge into the dense, traffic-jammed heart of the city.
At the foot of Palatine Hill they turned left and walked northward
past the western front of the Imperial Palace. Glancing over
his shoulder as they reached the northwest corner of the sprawling
great structure, Longinus had a glimpse of the wing that had
been Claudia&rsquo;s apartment; once again he picked out the bedroom
window through which that morning he had heard the rising bugle
at Castra Praetoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, did you say something?&rdquo; His helper, trudging behind,
paused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Longinus turned to face him. &ldquo;I was just thinking, talking
to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the way from the dock area Longinus had been retracing the
route he had come with his century from Castra Praetoria the day
they sailed for Palestine. But a hundred paces farther on, instead
of continuing past the Forum of Augustus on their left, he turned
abruptly westward. &ldquo;I want to walk through the Forum Romanum,&rdquo;
he explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve been
there. I&rsquo;ve lost touch with Rome. What&rsquo;s been happening lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little, sir, as far as I&rsquo;ve seen.&rdquo; The fellow shook his head
resignedly. &ldquo;No triumphs, as I recall, no big ones anyway, and
precious few games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t there been more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, sir. They say the Emperor gets no enjoyment
out of such things, and he&rsquo;s not here in Rome most of the
time anyway, and I hear it told that the Prefect doesn&rsquo;t want to
spend the money....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, sir, I have heard such talk. Understand, I don&rsquo;t know
anything about it; I don&rsquo;t know anything about them, the Emperor
and the Prefect. Not a thing. I don&rsquo;t even know whether
I&rsquo;d recognize either one of them if he came right up to us now.&rdquo;
The fellow&rsquo;s fear that he had spoken too boldly was obvious. &ldquo;All I
ever get done, sir, is work; I have to struggle hard to make a living.
Seems that it&rsquo;s just like it&rsquo;s always been in Rome, the way I see it,
which is that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.&rdquo; He
grinned good-naturedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m meaning no offense to you, Centurion;
likely you&rsquo;re one of the rich ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, and I suspect it&rsquo;s a sound observation, that the
rich do get richer and the poor get poorer, I mean. But it&rsquo;s not
true of Rome alone; it&rsquo;s that way everywhere, isn&rsquo;t it, throughout
the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say as to that, sir. Rome&rsquo;s pretty much my world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rome was his world, too, Longinus told himself a moment later
as the two were propelled suddenly from the shaded cavern of the
cobblestoned narrow street into the widened stir and commotion
of a veritable forest of marbled columns and statuary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>The centurion&rsquo;s heart lifted as he strode once more into the
Forum Romanum, that busy, marble-crowded flat between the
Tiber&rsquo;s westward bend and the mansion-crowned hills. He took
a deep breath, and his chest swelled.</p>
<p><i>... This is the veritable beating, pulsing heart of Rome, and
Rome is the world. Here is reality. Here are solidity, strength, planning
made real, dreams hewn in enduring stone. Here are wealth,
accomplishment, power, might. Not twenty paces across there is
the Millenarium Aureum, the resplendent bronze column set up
to mark the center of the Roman world, the point from which
miles are counted along the highways and their joining sea lanes
stretching to the ends of the known earth to bind Rome into one
colossal, unconquerable, enduring Empire!...</i></p>
<p>They paused to catch their breath. Longinus set down the glass,
but he continued to clutch the toga-wrapped packet under his arm.
In another moment they would push once more into the jostling,
shoving multitude milling through the Forum&rsquo;s crossways. Suddenly
the centurion remembered Cornelius and their discussion
that afternoon as the two men had sat in the wrecked rowboat
near the glassworks. He smiled grimly.</p>
<p><i>... But this is Rome. This is reality. This is accomplishment,
creation. I can reach out and run my hand over the stone and feel
these marbled creations of men; a thousand years from now, were
I to live so long, I could rub my hands across their imperishable
cold faces. These are tangible things, and Rome is tangible, her
power, her strength, her wealth, her dominance over the world.
Cornelius may prate of his old tutor&rsquo;s preachments about the imperishability
of the intangibles and the reality of things unseen.
But these statues, these temples, this Millenarium Aureum, are
tangible. Rome is carved statuary and fluted marble magnificence;
Rome is spacious mansions and marching great armies flaunting
their ensigns. Rome is poverty, too, and injustice and ugliness at
times and in places, but Rome is no pale intangibles, no vaporous
conjurations of an eastern philosopher. Rome is not even her gods.
This is Rome, this marbled splendor of the Forum; Rome is here
and now and touchable and real, and Rome, by all the gods or no
gods, will endure.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p><i>... Rome is something else. Rome is strength and power and
substance, but Rome is also grace and beauty. Examine these graceful
columns, these elegant pediments. Rome is feminine, a beautiful
woman. Rome, by the great Jove, is Claudia. Indeed! What is
more Rome than Claudia; what is more Claudia than Rome?
Rome is beauty and pleasure, tangible, real, to be experienced,
enjoyed.</i></p>
<p><i>... And Rome will endure. That carpenter of Galilee, wandering
up and down the seacoast with his little band of poor working
people, talking of intangibles to illiterate fisherfolk and the dwellers
in Jerusalem&rsquo;s festering Ophel, that fellow to overcome Rome!
Even under the silvery softness of a full moon beside the sea in
Galilee, it was a preposterous notion. But here in the middle
of the Forum, with confirmation of Rome&rsquo;s might everywhere
around....</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the gods, Cornelius. Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man carrying Longinus&rsquo; belongings whirled suddenly
around. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;did you command
anything of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus laughed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I was just thinking
aloud again. I must be growing old.&rdquo; He reached down and picked
up the glassware package. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s be moving on. I&rsquo;m anxious
to get to my father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; He pointed the directions. &ldquo;Out that
way and on through the Forum of Augustus to Via Longa. The
house is on Quirinal Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c28">28</h2>
<p>Longinus placed the package on the desk in front of the Prefect.
&ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m delivering this to you just as I received it at the glassworks,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I have not seen the contents; I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s
inside. The package when it was handed to me was sealed as you
see it now; the seals have not been broken.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Centurion, for bringing it; it has been quite a
responsibility, I know.&rdquo; The Prefect&rsquo;s darting eyes, Longinus saw,
had examined the package already. The centurion, appraising
Sejanus in the short moment he had been in the ornate chamber,
had observed no change in the Prefect&rsquo;s appearance. Judging by
the man&rsquo;s looks and demeanor, it might well have been only yesterday
that they had last met. The small, cold eyes were just as
carefully calculating as they had been the day the Prefect had
given Longinus his orders and sent him and Cornelius eastward
aboard the &ldquo;Palmyra.&rdquo; Now the eyes were disarmingly friendly.
&ldquo;My purpose in having it so well sealed was not because I didn&rsquo;t
trust you, Longinus, but because I wished the manager at the glassworks
to know that no one but himself could be blamed in the
event that the contents were subsequently found short. I knew
that he would therefore make sure that the packet left Phoenicia
intact.&rdquo; The blinking, small eyes narrowed. &ldquo;So actually, you see,
it was a protection for you.&rdquo; With a flourish of the hand he motioned
to the chair in front of the massive desk. &ldquo;Sit down, Centurion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo; Longinus took the seat and faced the Prefect.</p>
<p>Sejanus leaned forward and crossed his hands on the desk. &ldquo;In
all likelihood, Centurion, you&rsquo;ve been wondering why I summoned
you to Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have wondered, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure you have. And I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve also guessed that
I dispatched my message to you before receiving your report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had presumed so, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And right you were. Had I received the report but a few days
earlier I would not have summoned you here. But once I&rsquo;d received
your communication, I had no way of countermanding
my order to you so that you would get it before sailing for Rome.&rdquo;
He sat back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest; his entire
attitude radiated good humor. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad it happened as it
did, Longinus. I&rsquo;d rather like to hear in person from you concerning
the situation in Palestine. It was a good report, Centurion, and
comprehensive, so far as such written reports go. But I had the
feeling in reading it that you might have had further information
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
to give had you been able to talk with me directly. Perhaps discretion
had cramped your writing hand.&rdquo; Now his smile was disarming.
&ldquo;But here, with no ears to hear us but our own, we can talk
with complete freedom. I, too, can say things that I would not
dare write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prefect unfolded his arms and, leaning forward, drummed
his fingers on the desk. He studied the centurion briefly through
narrowed eyes, then sat back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you leave the Procurator, Longinus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was quite well, sir, when I left him at Caesarea. But your
message overtook me at Tiberias, and I had then been away from
Caesarea for some time. I went on to the glassworks and sailed
from Tyre, as you suggested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have seen Herod Antipas quite recently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I saw the Tetrarch and Herodias and told them
good-by just before leaving Tiberias. I had escorted them to Galilee
from their landing at Caesarea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did the daughter of King Aretas accept Herod&rsquo;s new
wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t, sir. She has left him and returned to her father.
She....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By winged Mercury!&rdquo; Sejanus lunged forward and slammed
his fist against the desk. &ldquo;Gone, you say? Fled to Aretas? By great
Jupiter! But this you did not report, Longinus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, Herod didn&rsquo;t know she was gone until we arrived at his
capital. I was preparing to dispatch a report to you when I received
your summons, and then I decided I would bring the report in
person, instead.&rdquo; He ventured a wan smile, and the Prefect himself
relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand; you did right, Centurion.&rdquo; Then his countenance
darkened, and his narrow forehead wrinkled. &ldquo;This is a matter of
considerable moment; I shall come back to it presently.&rdquo; He shook
his head. &ldquo;Yes, it could have dire repercussions. But for the moment,
let us speak of more pleasant things.&rdquo; His small weasel-like
face lighted with a thin but suggestive smile. &ldquo;Longinus, when did
you last see Claudia? How is the Procurator&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her in Tiberias the day before I left there for Phoenicia,
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
sir. Herodias and Herod Antipas had invited her to accompany
them to Tiberias for a visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Pilate didn&rsquo;t object to her going up into Galilee with
them ... and you?&rdquo; He licked his lips and drew them in thin
lines across his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he did, sir, he did not indicate anything of the sort to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the Procurator would do nothing that he thought
might displease the Emperor&rsquo;s stepdaughter. But what he thinks,
however, is a different matter, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is, sir.&rdquo; Longinus expected momentarily that the
Prefect would begin plying him with intimately personal questions
concerning his relations with the Procurator&rsquo;s wife, and he wondered
desperately how he should answer. But, happily, Sejanus
turned away from the Procurator&rsquo;s affairs to return to a discussion
of the Tetrarch&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were saying a moment ago, Longinus&rdquo;&mdash;the familiar scowl
had returned to the Prefect&rsquo;s face&mdash;&ldquo;that Herod&rsquo;s wife has gone
back to old Aretas. Have you had any reports concerning his feelings
toward Herod for the way his daughter has been treated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was greatly angered, according to reports coming back to
Galilee, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sejanus shook his head slowly. &ldquo;No doubt.&rdquo; He reflected a moment.
&ldquo;Has there been any talk of possible reprisal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been some talk that Aretas might attempt to punish
Herod. But that would mean war, sir, and war with us Romans.
So I feel that Aretas would hardly be so foolhardy as to attempt
to send an army against Herod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so, either, Centurion. But a father will sometimes
do foolish things when his daughter&rsquo;s honor is at stake. If
Aretas should challenge Herod, that will mean war, and war is expensive,
Longinus. The cost in terms of both men and money is
exorbitant ... and useless. War would also mean loss of work
and production and loss of revenue in addition to the expenditure
of revenue already collected.&rdquo; His frown deepened. &ldquo;By the great
gods, I should never have permitted Herod to have Herodias. He
has not only offended his own people; he has now set King Aretas
against him ... and us!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Angrily the Prefect drummed his fingers on the desk again.
Then quickly his anger seemed to disappear. He arose, and the
centurion stood with him. &ldquo;But we need not anticipate events,&rdquo;
Sejanus said. &ldquo;When you go back to Palestine, however, I want
you to make a careful investigation of the situation. It might be
well for you to contrive some reason for visiting our fortress at
Machaerus; it&rsquo;s over beyond the Dead Sea on the borders of
Arabia; perhaps by going there you may learn whether Aretas is
actually planning to attack Herod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m familiar with the place, sir. I was there several years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. By the way, in your report of Herod&rsquo;s arrest of that desert
preacher, you indicated that he may have displeased a large number
of the Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident he did, sir. Many of them hold that John in the
highest regard. I think Herod made a mistake, sir, and I felt it my
duty to inform you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wasn&rsquo;t Herod justified in believing him to be an insurrectionist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first, sir, I confess I thought so. But Cornelius, who understands
the Jews, insisted that he was just a harmless religious
fanatic, and nothing more. Frankly I soon came to the same conclusion.
The fellow is deluded, of course, but so are most of the
Jews in respect to their foolish one-god religion; other than that,
I&rsquo;m convinced that he&rsquo;s entirely harmless. And he has many followers
who were deeply offended when Herod, at the insistence of
Herodias, had him arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the gods, that headstrong woman! She will be Herod&rsquo;s
ruination!&rdquo; He was thoughtfully silent. &ldquo;Perhaps, Centurion,
Rome might profit if I had the man liberated. At any rate, look
into the matter, and let me hear as quickly as you can&rdquo;&mdash;his scowl
deepened&mdash;&ldquo;if it will wait that long ... and if Aretas isn&rsquo;t precipitate
in sending an army against Herod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told you, Longinus,&rdquo; the Prefect interrupted. &ldquo;You
aren&rsquo;t returning at once to Palestine. Now that you&rsquo;re here, I have
another mission, quite urgent, that I&rsquo;m sending you on into Gaul.
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
When you have accomplished this&mdash;and it should require only a
few months&mdash;you will go out to the east again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sejanus pushed out his lips into a round pucker, and once more
his eyes began to catch fire and his narrow face lighted sensually.
Then he twisted his lips again into the thin semblance of a smile.
&ldquo;I hope, Centurion, that you can wait that long ... before getting
back to Claudia!&rdquo; Then quickly the smile was gone. &ldquo;Remember,
Longinus, she must be kept away from Rome, and it will
continue to be your task to keep her happily occupied.&rdquo; The lips
twisted again. &ldquo;That task, I should think, will not be an unpleasant
one.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 title=""><span class="sc">Machaerus</span></h2>

<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<h2 id="c29">29</h2>
<p>Someone knocked on the door to Claudia&rsquo;s apartment, and Tullia
was sent to answer it. She ran quickly back into the tepidarium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tertius says there&rsquo;s a soldier to see you, Mistress, a centurion.
He&rsquo;s waiting in the atrium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longinus! Oh, by the Bountiful Mother!&rdquo; But quickly
Claudia&rsquo;s elation subsided. &ldquo;He must still be in Gaul, though,
according to the information Sergius Paulus had from Rome.
Still&rdquo;&mdash;her face lighted&mdash;&ldquo;he might have returned early, perhaps,
and caught a fast vessel to Caesarea. Bona Dea, Tullia, help me
finish dressing! The perfume, that vial&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed&mdash;&ldquo;the Tyrian.
And do hurry, Tullia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later she scurried breathlessly into the atrium.
But the soldier was not Longinus. The Centurion Cornelius arose
and advanced to meet her. He saw her disappointment and smiled
understanding. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Claudia, but Longinus hasn&rsquo;t returned
to Palestine, nor have we heard at Tiberias when he expects to
arrive. I&rsquo;ve come to bring you a message from the Tetrarch Herod
Antipas and the Tetrarchess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll confess I was hoping Longinus had surprised me, Cornelius,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;although I&rsquo;d heard that he was still in Gaul.
Did you know about his assignment out there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius nodded. &ldquo;Yes. But we understood it was not to be a
lengthy mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia motioned to a seat; she sat down and Cornelius sat
facing her. She summoned Tertius to bring wine and wafers. &ldquo;And
now, Centurion,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what is the message you fetch me
from Tiberias?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are inviting you and the Procurator to go with them
down to Machaerus to spend a holiday season there. And if the
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
Procurator&rsquo;s duties will not permit his leaving his post, the Tetrarchess
hopes that you will join them anyway, together with your
servants and any guests you may wish to bring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Machaerus? That&rsquo;s the fortress castle on the other side of
the Dead Sea, isn&rsquo;t it, on the southern border of Peraea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s on a high plateau overlooking the Dead Sea, some
way south of Mount Nebo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wild and desolate country, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ve never been there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand so; I&rsquo;ve never been there myself. A good place,
they say in Tiberias, for the sort of holiday the Tetrarch particularly
enjoys ... wild, uninhibited, like himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia laughed appreciatively. &ldquo;It promises to be interesting
at any rate. But&rdquo;&mdash;her face clouded perceptibly&mdash;&ldquo;I know that
Pilate won&rsquo;t go. In the first place, he loathes Antipas&mdash;and I do,
too, as a matter of fact&mdash;and in the second place, he wouldn&rsquo;t venture
that far from provincial headquarters. But he might let me go.
And it would be a change from this dreary existence.&rdquo; She brightened.
&ldquo;When are they planning to make this holiday excursion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, they&rsquo;ve probably already started. They sent
me on ahead in the hope that you might agree to join them; if
you should, I&rsquo;m to escort you and your party to the Jordan,
where they plan to meet us. They were to start this morning from
Tiberias. If we could leave by tomorrow morning, we would be
able to reach the Jordan at about the same time they do. From
there we would continue down the Jordan Valley to the Dead
Sea and around its eastern shore at the foot of Mount Nebo to
Machaerus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do they plan to be there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week or longer, probably longer&rdquo;&mdash;Cornelius smiled glumly&mdash;&ldquo;if
the Tetrarch has to recover from one of his usual drunken
orgies. But if you should wish to leave earlier, I&rsquo;d be glad to
escort you back to Caesarea. And we&rsquo;ll see that you don&rsquo;t ran
afoul of Bar Abbas or any of those other zealot cutthroats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really would like to go, and I see no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t,
even if Pilate won&rsquo;t. If I only knew that Longinus would be there.&rdquo;
... She broke off, laughing. &ldquo;Cornelius, why do you suppose old
Sejanus recalled him to Rome? Do you think it was because of&rdquo;&mdash;she
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
shrugged&mdash;&ldquo;well, us? And do you suppose he&rsquo;ll continue to
provide assignments that will keep him away from Palestine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius shook his head. &ldquo;I hardly think so, Claudia. The Prefect,
in my opinion, summoned him to Rome to inquire about the
situation out here. I think he wanted to learn about the temper
of the people, how the Jews were taking to Antipas and his new
wife, and to the new Procurator; that was one reason, I&rsquo;m sure.
But he was mainly interested in learning whether the revenue was
flowing into his treasury without being diverted in part into the
coffers of....&rdquo; He paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pilate and Antipas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my opinion, Claudia. I don&rsquo;t believe the Prefect is
really concerned with anything beyond keeping the province peacefully
paying its taxes. So I&rsquo;m confident Longinus will be sent back
to Palestine, he&rsquo;s the man Sejanus needs for the job he gave
him ... and still needs; he&rsquo;ll be back, though I&rsquo;d hesitate to predict
when.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;For a soldier, I&rsquo;ve been
speaking very freely, and to the wife of the Procurator, at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for the wife of the Procurator, so have I. But I&rsquo;m not
na&iuml;ve enough to think, Cornelius, that you don&rsquo;t know just how
little I am Pilate&rsquo;s wife. You must feel free to talk with me in
complete frankness, just as I feel free to talk that way with you.
And tomorrow, by the gods, Pilate willing or Pilate grumbling&mdash;and
he won&rsquo;t grumble at me, by the Great Mother&mdash;I&rsquo;ll start with
you for Machaerus.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c30">30</h2>
<p>The two sat in a protected spot of warming sunshine on the terrace
at Machaerus. A week ago as the caravan bringing the Tetrarch&rsquo;s
party had moved down the low trough of the Jordan, the
faintly greening willows and oleanders bordering the twisting
stream had hinted of spring. But here on this desolate, upflung
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
headland, barren and granite-capped, the March winds were crisply
chill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo; Herodias asked. &ldquo;Would you like to go inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s wonderful out here, as long as we&rsquo;re sheltered from
the wind. It&rsquo;s so bracing, so invigorating after all our dissipating....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, I haven&rsquo;t been aware of your dissipating at
Machaerus. With Longinus not here....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pluto roast old Sejanus! But too much wine, nevertheless, and
entirely too much rich food.&rdquo; Claudia looked out from beneath
long eyelashes. &ldquo;After all, isn&rsquo;t more indulging done in banquet
halls than in bedrooms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, yes, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Tetrarch is here with you, Herodias, and he appears
to be in a gay holiday mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here with me? Hah!&rdquo; She tossed her head disdainfully. &ldquo;With
his women, you mean, those dark, fat, greasy, perfume-reeking
Arabian women old Aretas gave him. And his little girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Hadn&rsquo;t you noticed? They seem at the moment to be an
important part of the Machaerus staff. As Antipas gets more senile&mdash;and
I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s getting that way&mdash;he tries more and more to
ape the Emperor. At least, that&rsquo;s what I believe he thinks he&rsquo;s
doing. It&rsquo;s disgusting, of course, but I welcome being relieved of
his crude attentions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in Rome, Herodias, weren&rsquo;t you eager to marry Antipas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you know why. I wanted to marry the Tetrarch of
Galilee and Peraea so that I could make him a king and myself a
queen. I sought the office, my dear, not the man.&rdquo; She pulled her
lips into a determined grim line. &ldquo;And I still expect to see him
on a king&rsquo;s throne, with me seated beside him. But as a man
Antipas has as much attraction for me as ... as I suppose Pilate
has for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia laughed understanding, but made no observation. Instead,
she pointed westward. &ldquo;Look how high we are here. The
Dead Sea seems almost below us, and it must be several miles
away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;The surface of the Dead Sea is a quarter of a mile below the
surface of the Great Sea. And we&rsquo;re a half mile above the Great
Sea; that would make us, where we sit now, about four thousand
feet above the Dead Sea, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Jerusalem, of course, is almost
this high.&rdquo; Herodias twisted around slightly to point northwestward.
&ldquo;See, across there, almost straight west of the top of the
Dead Sea, that&rsquo;s Jerusalem. It&rsquo;s too far away, of course, for us to
distinguish any of the buildings, but the city&rsquo;s on that rise, just
there. Sometimes of a late afternoon, when the angle is just right,
they say, one can see the sunlight flashing from the golden roof
of the Temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia looked off to her left and settled back in her chair.
&ldquo;Herodias, why did they ever build this palace in such a desolate,
rockbound region so far from everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked Antipas the same question. He said it was built more as
a fort than a palace. This is near the southern boundary of the
tetrarchy. Down there&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed southward above a narrow
valley fast greening with luxuriant vegetation&mdash;&ldquo;beyond that
stream with its banks lined with willows is the kingdom of Aretas.
The Herods originally came from that region at the southern end
of the Dead Sea, which was called Idumaea. So this fortress up
here was built as a defense post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Aretas isn&rsquo;t far away, is he? By the way, what became of
his daughter, the woman you displaced?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and what&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; She realized that
she had spoken petulantly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be short, Claudia.
I have no reason to hate her, after all. And I have no idea that
she or her father will attempt reprisal against Antipas. Any attack
upon him would be an attack upon Rome, and surely they
wouldn&rsquo;t risk that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you need have no apprehensions. But, of course, I
know absolutely nothing about this King Aretas or his daughter.
Generally, though, I understand, these eastern peoples are impulsive
and vindictive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re also known to be very shrewd. Surely he would
know he couldn&rsquo;t defeat Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he calmly considered the situation, yes.&rdquo; She shrugged. &ldquo;I
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
hope so. If Rome should be involved in war with the Arabian
king, Sejanus and the Emperor would both be infuriated, and
Sejanus, I&rsquo;m sure, would place the blame for it upon Antipas ...
and you.&rdquo; She had been looking downward beyond the descending
outcroppings of granite and limestone and sand to the great
sluggish salt sea far below them. But now she confronted Herodias,
her countenance plainly concerned. &ldquo;Herodias, if Aretas should
seek vengeance against the Tetrarch and you, what would the
Israelites do? Would they fight him? Have they become reconciled
to your being Tetrarchess? Do many of them still hold with
that wild fellow we encountered that day on the river bank?&rdquo; She
paused, and suddenly her eyes were roundly questioning. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t
it to Machaerus that Antipas sent him? By the gods, is he here
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and still a troublemaker. They say his followers have been
coming here all the time since he&rsquo;s been imprisoned. Haven&rsquo;t you
noticed all the Jews coming and going while we&rsquo;ve been here?
Look.&rdquo; She indicated a point far down the slope where the trail
to Machaerus led from the road paralleling the lakeside. &ldquo;That
group down there, I&rsquo;d wager they&rsquo;re coming here to listen to the
fellow&rsquo;s haranguing. And they&rsquo;ll try to see Antipas and petition
him to free the madman.&rdquo; For a moment she watched the men
coming slowly up the slope. &ldquo;If Antipas had done as I said and had
the man beheaded, he could have prevented all this; while that
fellow&rsquo;s alive there&rsquo;ll be more and more agitation against us.&rdquo; She
hunched up a shoulder. &ldquo;But what can one do with a person,&rdquo; she
said indifferently, &ldquo;who is not only fearful and woefully superstitious
but is horribly obstinate as well?&rdquo; She stood up. &ldquo;Excuse
me, Claudia; you stay out here and sun yourself as long as you
like. But I have some things to do before we sit down to Antipas&rsquo;
birthday banquet, one of which, no doubt&rdquo;&mdash;her brittle laugh
echoed across the terrace&mdash;&ldquo;will be to get him sobered sufficiently
to attend it himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2 id="c31">31</h2>
<p>The Tetrarch, mouth open, his thick lips grease-smeared and wine-purpled,
snored sonorously; his round, closely cropped head,
cradled in his hand, swayed in precarious balance on the column
of his forearm which was pressed into the heavy cushion.</p>
<p>Herodias, reclining at his left, had changed position to rest her
head on her right arm and thereby avoid somewhat breathing the
heavily alcoholic exhalations of her spouse; she lay facing her
daughter.</p>
<p>Claudia, Herod&rsquo;s guest of honor, was at his right, and next to
her, as the ranking Roman soldier at Machaerus, Herod had placed
the Centurion Cornelius. Other guests, in various stages of intoxication,
sat or reclined on their elbows or had fallen inert on their
couches to the right and left of the Tetrarch.</p>
<p>The banquet had begun in the daylight of late afternoon, and
by the time the sun had dropped behind the western headlands
the Tetrarch and his guests had begun to be surfeited with the
richly tempting food, the wine, and the wildly sensual dancing of
Herod&rsquo;s darkly handsome Arabian women, who, nude but for
gossamer thin, gaily colored loincloths, writhed and twisted in the
open square before the tables to the oriental, whining insistence of
the strings and the maddeningly rhythmical beat of the drums.</p>
<p>But now the dancers, their copper-hued perspiring bodies shining
as though they had been rubbed with olive oil, had retired to
a chamber adjoining the banquet room. From there they could
come prancing out barefoot, with lewd twistings and contortings,
at the first summons of the musicians. Until Antipas should arouse
from his stupor, though, and call for them, they would be free to
relax.</p>
<p>Cornelius, who had been eying the Tetrarch, nodded in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
direction. &ldquo;If we could get his head down flat,&rdquo; he said to Claudia,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;d be asleep until morning, and we could leave. Wouldn&rsquo;t you
like to get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m gorged. And I&rsquo;d like to have a breath of fresh air on
the terrace. Perhaps Herodias would excuse us. I had no idea that
Antipas....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at that instant the Tetrarch&rsquo;s head slipped from its cradling
hand, and he fell face downward upon the cushion. The sudden
drop awakened him, and he twisted his legs around heavily and
sat up. The leader of the musicians, seeing him, signaled his men
to begin playing and motioned to the dancers to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; shouted the Tetrarch. &ldquo;We have had enough of their
dancing! But now, my friends&rdquo;&mdash;Antipas faced right and left to
look along the couches, as his guests began to sit up&mdash;&ldquo;I shall
provide you with more novel entertainment.&rdquo; He paused and
reached for his wine goblet. &ldquo;I ask your pardon for having gone to
sleep, although I&rsquo;m sure a number of you did likewise. During our
stay at Machaerus I have been overindulging in food and wine and,
for a man of my age, certainly, other more strenuous pleasures.&rdquo;
He ran his thick tongue over his greasy lips and smiled lewdly.
&ldquo;But now&rdquo;&mdash;he signaled two of the guards standing at the doorway
opening upon the terrace&mdash;&ldquo;go into the dungeon and fetch to our
birthday feast the Wilderness prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herodias whirled about to confront him, her countenance betraying
both anger and amazement. &ldquo;Why should the Tetrarch
bring that depraved madman here to insult his guests, his wife,
and himself? Has the Tetrarch permitted too much wine and too
many women...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, my dear! And be calm. I am not having him brought
before us to insult us. On the contrary, he will ask our pardon
for his intemperate words, and we shall release him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Release him! By all the gods, can the Tetrarch be speaking
seriously? Does he for one moment contemplate giving this notorious
insurrectionist his freedom to resume his agitating against us,
against Rome...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Tetrarchess, Rome, as represented by the Centurion
Cornelius,&rdquo; he interrupted, as he glanced toward the centurion
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
and then turned his head the other way to address his wife,
&ldquo;thinks that releasing this man will be not only an evidence of the
Tetrarch&rsquo;s magnanimity but also a politic act greatly pleasing to
a countless number of our Jewish brothers. It was he who suggested....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are not you Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea? Was it not
your wife and you, not the centurion, whom this revolutionary
castigated so bitterly? And has he not sought to inflame the
people even against Rome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia had turned to confront Cornelius; she said nothing,
but her eyes were sharply questioning. He bent forward and spoke
quietly, so that none of the others would hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did suggest that it would be a good idea&mdash;especially in so far
as Sejanus is concerned&mdash;for him to free the man, since it would
please the Jews and the man is plainly no insurrectionist against
Rome. But I didn&rsquo;t know he meant to have the fellow brought
before us. The man should have been freed quietly, with no fanfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, I think he would have done better,&rdquo; Claudia whispered
to Cornelius, &ldquo;to have had the fellow beheaded, but quietly.&rdquo;
She leaned nearer the centurion. &ldquo;Antipas craves attention; he tries
to be dramatic. He&rsquo;s always....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But suddenly she stopped, for the guards, flanking the manacled
prisoner, were entering the great hall. They escorted John into the
open square before the Tetrarch&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unbind him,&rdquo; the Tetrarch commanded, &ldquo;and step back from
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant the guards had removed the shackles about the
prophet&rsquo;s wrists and retreated to their former places at the doorway.</p>
<p>Though not all the Tetrarch&rsquo;s guests had completely sobered,
every eye was on the Wilderness preacher. In the months he had
been imprisoned in the Machaerus dungeon, John had lost the
leathery deep burn of the desert, but otherwise he was little
changed. He was tall and erect and perhaps even more gaunt than
he had appeared to be the day Antipas had ordered his arrest; his
coarse brown robe, belted with a woven rope at the waist, hung
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
loosely about him. But his eyes still blazed with the zealot&rsquo;s fire as,
relaxed and silent, he stood calmly facing the Tetrarch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the Prophet John of the Wilderness and the Jordan
Valley?&rdquo; Antipas asked, his tone and manner almost friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I been so long in your dungeon, O Tetrarch, that you
can&rsquo;t be sure you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question and the tone in which it was framed were sarcastic,
even patronizing, but the Tetrarch appeared to take no
offense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an idle query, and you have been a long time in prison.
Perhaps your intemperate words to the Tetrarch and the Tetrarchess
have been sufficiently punished.&rdquo; Antipas smiled blandly
and rubbed his fat hands together. &ldquo;Our banqueting this day is
an occasion of joy and merriment; it is our birthday and to mark
it further the Tetrarch is happy to demonstrate before these our
honored guests, including even the wife of the great Procurator
Pontius Pilate&rdquo;&mdash;he bowed toward Claudia, who had been listening
avidly&mdash;&ldquo;and our honored Centurion Cornelius, his softness
of heart toward his subjects. Today a group of the prophet&rsquo;s followers&rdquo;&mdash;now
he bowed toward John&mdash;&ldquo;has petitioned the Tetrarch
to liberate him. These men assured us that you&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke directly
to the gaunt preacher&mdash;&ldquo;have never had any thought of insurrection
against the government of Rome or the Tetrarch but
that you were concerned only with the promulgation of our true
religion. I agreed I would grant their petition. Now as soon as you
satisfy me that you will cause us no further trouble and express
your regret for the intemperate and malicious words with which
you castigated the Tetrarch and his beloved Tetrarchess, as soon
as you assure us that you have repented of your evil words....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repented!&rdquo; John&rsquo;s eyes blazed. &ldquo;I have nothing for which to repent
to you, O Tetrarch! My repentance is to the God of Israel
against whom I have sinned and continue to sin. But I have done
you no evil. I call upon you to repent, O you of evil and lustful
heart, you robber of your brother&rsquo;s bed!&rdquo; The prophet lifted himself
upon his sandaled toes and pointed with lean forearm straight
upward toward the ceiling dome. &ldquo;Repent! Repent! Repent, for
your days are numbered! The Messiah of God, Him of Whom I
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
spoke in the Wilderness and along the Jordan lowlands, had come!
Even now He walks up and down Galilee preaching of the coming
of the Kingdom and bringing blessed salvation to those whose
ears are bent to hear Him. The time of repentance, O Tetrarch,
is now!&rdquo; He lowered his gaunt arm, and the robe fell about it,
and he swept it in an arc in the faces of the diners on the square
of couches. &ldquo;Repent! Repent! Cast away your sins and be cleansed,
and be baptized!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the preacher paused, and his blazing eyes settled upon
the Tetrarchess. He thrust out his arm and held it before the
startled woman&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;And you, repent, you evil woman, you deserter
of your lawful bed, return to your husband, forswear your
adulterous cohabiting....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; Herodias, eyes flashing her uncontrollable
rage, her cheeks flaming, had sprung to her feet. She leaned across
the food-covered, disordered table. &ldquo;By all the gods, O Tetrarch&rdquo;&mdash;she
turned to grasp her husband&rsquo;s shoulder as he sat upright
on the couch&mdash;&ldquo;I will hear no more of this evil madman&rsquo;s prattle.
Send him away&mdash;have him shot with arrows, or order him beheaded,
or throw him again into the dungeon&mdash;by the great Jove,
I don&rsquo;t care what you do with him, but I will not remain here with
him and be further insulted!&rdquo; She shook his shoulder furiously.
&ldquo;Do you understand, Antipas? Do you understand, by the Great
Mother Ceres?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tetrarch stumbled to his feet, swayed, but clutched the
table edge to steady himself. &ldquo;Take your seat, my dear,&rdquo; he said
evenly. &ldquo;I understand very well what you say. And you speak the
truth.&rdquo; He turned from her to face the desert preacher. &ldquo;I had
meant to hand you your freedom, Wilderness prophet; I had meant
to give you into the care of your friends who remained here tonight
to take you back into Judaea. But your vicious tirade against
us forces me to change my plans for you.&rdquo; He beckoned to the
two guards. &ldquo;Manacle him, and return him to the dungeon,&rdquo; he
commanded.</p>
<p>Quickly they fettered his wrists and, grasping him by the arms,
led him toward the door through which moments ago they had
brought him into the chamber. John walked silently, head erect
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
and unafraid. But as they were about to go out through the doorway,
he jerked his arms free, and whirled about to face the
Tetrarch and his guests. Raising the manacled hands, he pointed
toward the Tetrarch. &ldquo;Repent, adulterer!&rdquo; His blazing eyes sought
the still incensed Herodias. &ldquo;And you, whore of Rome, get you
back to your Babylon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guards jerked their prisoner through the doorway, and the
door closed heavily behind them. The banqueters, silenced by the
bitter exchange between Herodias and the prophet, listened to
the retreating footsteps of the three along the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow&rsquo;s a fool,&rdquo; Claudia observed in a low aside to Cornelius,
&ldquo;but he does have courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he must believe that he&rsquo;s serving his Yahweh and Yahweh&rsquo;s
Messiah,&rdquo; the centurion agreed; &ldquo;that faith must be the source of
his courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amazing. I cannot understand how these Jews can be so
swayed by such silly superstition. I do wonder what Antipas will
do with him; Herodias, if she could, would have his head off in a
minute. And so would I, if he had talked to me as he did to her.&rdquo;
She tossed her head and smiled indifferently. &ldquo;But why should I
be concerned about this Jewish fanatic? I don&rsquo;t care one green
Campanian fig what happens to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she reached for her wine goblet, which a servant had refilled,
Antipas set his down and stood up. The servant hastened to
fill the Tetrarch&rsquo;s. Antipas licked his thick lips. &ldquo;By the beard of
the High Priest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I really intended to liberate the prophet.
His imprisonment is on his own head.&rdquo; He clutched the table&rsquo;s
edge to steady himself again. Then he grasped his wine goblet
and drained it in one gulp. The servant raced around the table
to refill the empty glass. Antipas picked it up and twirled it
slowly on its slender stem, &ldquo;Drink, my friends! Let us dispel this
sudden gloom. Isn&rsquo;t this the Tetrarch&rsquo;s birthday? Drink! Drink!&rdquo;
He downed the wine as his guests, lifting their goblets, drank to
their host. Antipas clapped his hands. &ldquo;And now, music and the
dancing women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader signaled to his men, and the musicians began their
lively playing, as the Arabian dancers came scampering again into
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
the hollow square before the tables. Antipas sat down, rested his
head on the palm of his left hand, and with his right reached
for the glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon now he&rsquo;ll be very drunk, and we can escape,&rdquo; Cornelius
whispered to Claudia. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s still afraid of the Wilderness preacher,
and he will try to drown his fears in wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he just ordered the fellow back to the dungeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He also fears Herodias. He&rsquo;ll free John, though, as soon as he
can do so without his wife&rsquo;s knowing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tempo of the music was increasing, and the women, refreshed
by the long intermission they had been having and the
food and wine they had been served, were fast approaching a
frenzy of abandon in their wild convolutions and sensual writhings.
For a few moments the jaded Tetrarch, watching the brazenly
lewd gyrations of the dancing women, appeared to be gaining
renewed stimulation. But quickly his interest faded; he sat up on
his couch and straightened himself. &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; he commanded, waving
his hand aloft. &ldquo;Enough of this. We are surfeited on dark
women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The music stopped. &ldquo;Let them go,&rdquo; said Antipas, nodding
toward the leader of the musicians. The man bowed to the
Tetrarch and, turning, waved his dismissal to the dancers, who
went tripping out. Once again the great triclinium was as still and
the guests as suddenly silent as they had been at the dramatic
entrance of the gaunt prophet.</p>
<p>Now the Tetrarch, beaming, looked to his left beyond his
Tetrarchess. &ldquo;It is our wish that our beloved daughter Salome
honor our birthday by dancing for the Tetrarch and his guests,&rdquo;
he declared in honeyed tones. &ldquo;Will you not dance for us, my
dear child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius leaned forward to watch Herodias&rsquo; daughter. Salome
seemed amazed at her stepfather&rsquo;s request. &ldquo;But, Sire,&rdquo; she ventured
to protest, as she turned on her couch to face the unctuously
smiling Tetrarch, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t my dear father know that I am not a
dancer? Surely he prefers the dancing of women trained in the
art.&rdquo; She shook her head firmly. &ldquo;Sire, I would not wish to display
before this company just how poorly....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh come now, my child, your dancing will delight the Tetrarch
and his guests. Do not let maidenly modesty deny us the pleasure
of seeing you perform.&rdquo; The Tetrarch&rsquo;s eyes were beginning
to flame. &ldquo;We would delight in your dancing, my dear. After all
that dark flesh, a flashing before us of firm, white, youthful....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Salome, the Tetrarch well knows, is not accustomed to
dancing before companies such as this.&rdquo; Herodias, her eyes challenging,
caught her husband&rsquo;s arm in protest. &ldquo;And has not the
Tetrarch seen enough already of both white and dark female
flesh? Is he not surfeited with women? Why should he wish to
see a child...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to see her dance, my dear Tetrarchess. I have never seen
her dance. And is this not my birthday? Shouldn&rsquo;t one be indulged
on his birthday?&rdquo; He leaned past his wife to plead again with
Salome. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you, my dear Salome, dance just this once, to
please and flatter your doting father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia leaned close to Cornelius. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe &lsquo;doting&rsquo; is
the word,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say &lsquo;drooling&rsquo; is more like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antipas was still pleading with the girl. &ldquo;If you will but dance
this once for us, Salome, my child,&rdquo; he said, his voice soft and
sugared, his round face disarmingly friendly, &ldquo;I will grant any request
you make of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could dance well, Sire, I would be happy to dance for the
Tetrarch, but I am not skilled in that art, nor do I have the mature
charms of the Arabian women nor the....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have the tender charms, my dear Salome, the virginal
charms of the bud about to open to full flowering. And I am
satiated with these wide-open flowers ready to shatter.&rdquo; He stood
up and braced himself against the table, then turned toward her
with renewed pleading. &ldquo;Dance for us, my dear. Dance for us, and
I will reward you what you will, I swear by the High Priest&rsquo;s beard,
even to the half of our tetrarchy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Sire, even were I able to please the Tetrarch with my
poor efforts, I am not suitably dressed....&rdquo; The girl paused,
for her mother had leaned over to whisper in her ear. She listened,
solemn-faced, and then, suddenly smiling, she turned back to address
the Tetrarch. &ldquo;Sire, if the Tetrarch would not unmercifully
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
censure my stumbling attempts, and&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated, and her smile
was demure&mdash;&ldquo;does the Tetrarch really intend seriously to grant
any request I might make of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been more serious in my life, my dear child. I fully
intend to keep my promise. Anything you want, a marble palace,
a pleasure barge to rival Cleopatra&rsquo;s, gold, precious gems, silks
from the Orient, anything; it is yours but for you to name it ...
after you have danced for the Tetrarch and his guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Sire.&rdquo; The girl stood up. &ldquo;I shall do my best to
please the Tetrarch and his guests on his birthday. But, first, I
must change my costume.&rdquo; Herodias arose unsteadily to stand beside
her. &ldquo;Mother will help me dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia leaned to her right to whisper to Cornelius. The Tetrarch,
absorbed in watching his wife and stepdaughter, would
hardly have heard her had she spoken aloud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Herodias who&rsquo;s
told her to dance for him. She&rsquo;s got some sort of scheme in mind,
and I&rsquo;m sure it hinges on that request. I wonder what it will
be....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius nodded. &ldquo;Something, I would say, that bodes the
Tetrarch no good. I&rsquo;ll be interested myself to see what Salome
will ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Herodias reappeared in the doorway. She
signaled to the leader of the musicians, and he went over to her;
she talked with him a moment, and then, as he rejoined his group,
she made her way around the couches to resume her place beside
the Tetrarch. Immediately the leader raised his hand, and the
musicians began to play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the great Jove!&rdquo; Cornelius, who had turned momentarily
to reply to something Claudia had said, glanced back toward the
doorway through which the Tetrarchess had returned. At his murmured
exclamation Claudia looked in the same direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Bona Dea! what a transformation!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Salome was standing just inside the doorway. When she had left
the chamber a few minutes ago she had been wearing a shimmering
white silken stola, held at the waist by a wide girdle of interlaced
narrow strips of green and gold, and golden sandals. Her
raven-black hair had been combed back from a part in the center
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
and bound in a loose knot at the back of her neck where it was
held neatly in place by a net. Her hair, like her mother&rsquo;s and
Claudia&rsquo;s, had been arranged in the style currently popular among
Roman women of the equestrian class.</p>
<p>But now the girl, immobile and statuesque, stood stripped of
every garment she had worn in leaving the chamber. At first
glance the centurion thought Salome had returned completely in
the nude, save for the few thin veils she had draped about her
shoulders. But looking more closely, he saw that her loins were
bound, though scantily, with a carefully folded flesh-colored veil.
To the casual observer and certainly to the aging Tetrarch, the girl
appeared to be standing before them divested of all her clothing.
The brightly colored veils even heightened the illusion. She was
barefoot, and her hair, freed from the restricting net and unbound,
fell past firm, outthrust breasts almost to her slim waist in a
tumbling dark cascade of curls. Salome looked as though, finding
herself unclad, she had pushed her black tresses suddenly through
a small wispish rainbow that had settled about her white shoulders
and slipped downward to her dimpled knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her charms seem quite mature,&rdquo; Cornelius whispered to
Claudia, grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suspect they&rsquo;re no longer virginal,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But,
by the gods, she must be sixteen, and&rdquo;&mdash;she leaned nearer and
spoke into his ear&mdash;&ldquo;whoever could imagine a Herodian virgin any
older!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia&rsquo;s caution had not been necessary, for the Tetrarch&rsquo;s dark
eyes, smoldering as though at any moment they might burst into
flame, were measuring and exploring and savoring the girl. Claudia,
following Cornelius&rsquo; eyes, glanced toward the entranced ruler and
then, turning back to the centurion, whispered again, &ldquo;Soon he&rsquo;ll
be drooling. He&rsquo;s mad, stark, raving mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The music had been soft and slow, but now Salome, with a
quick upward flexing of her fingers and a nod to signal the musicians,
stepped forward a pace and with shoulders twisting and
hips undulating came slithering into the opening between the
tables.</p>
<p>From high on a pilaster a shaded lamp cast a circle of bright
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
light in the center of the hollow square. As she tripped on the
balls of her bare feet, Salome held the sheer veils lightly to her
white body, arms crossed over her breasts, taking care to avoid the
full brightness of the illuminated circle. Once she ventured,
whirling and twisting, to come as close to the Tetrarch as the
position directly in front of Cornelius, but then teasingly she
doubled back the other way. When a moment later she reversed
her direction and came prancing between the bright circle and the
Tetrarch&rsquo;s couch, Antipas lunged forward to grasp her, but laughingly
she slipped from his reach and sped away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magnificent! Wonderful!&rdquo; he shouted, unabashed, as he sank
again to his couch and reached for his goblet. &ldquo;My child, you
restore the sap of youth to my aging limbs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the edge of the circle and straight across it from the Tetrarch,
Salome stopped, and as the drums ceased their throbbing
and the strings subsided to a whisper, she turned deliberately to
face the Tetrarch and his guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bountiful Ceres!&rdquo; Claudia kept her voice low. &ldquo;Is she going
to discard those veils?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Salome, with her arms still pressed across her chest, continued
to clutch the colored gauze protectively before her. The
music began to increase in volume, and hardly discernible at first
above the harmony of the strings and the flutes, the drums added
their insistent throbbing. Now the girl in the square before the
diners slowly withdrew her right arm, which had been crossed
underneath the left one, and lifted it high; at the same time she
pushed forward her left leg, so that the gossamer veils fell to
either side to expose it from toes to hip, and leaned back; the
leg, torso, and lifted arm to ringed forefinger made one continuous
straight line of vibrant, glowing, suddenly stilled flesh, veiled
but scantily by the diaphanous colored silks.</p>
<p>Cornelius ventured a glance toward the Tetrarch. Antipas, upright
on his couch, was leaning forward, mouth half open, dark
eyes staring unblinking at his stepdaughter and grandniece. The
centurion gently nudged Claudia. &ldquo;Any moment now,&rdquo; he whispered,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be lunging over the table again.&rdquo; But his eyes darted
quickly to the girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>Her head was back, in line with the rest of her body, and her
sultry eyes looked upward to her extended forefinger. Now it began
to move, almost imperceptibly, so that few of the Tetrarch&rsquo;s
guests were aware of the beginning of its motion. But Cornelius,
intrigued, saw the finger&rsquo;s movement widening and speeding; like
a serpent it was coiling and uncoiling, twisting sideways, darting,
writhing, all in perfect rhythm with the music. As he watched,
the motion of the finger appeared to flow like liquid downward to
involve the hand and then the forearm. Now along the graceful
length of her slender bare arm the smooth, unknotting muscles,
rippling and twisting, seemed to have transformed it into an
oriental adder swaying and bobbing to the compelling strains of
the charmer&rsquo;s flute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child&rsquo;s amazing, I must agree with the Tetrarch,&rdquo; Cornelius
said. &ldquo;Do you suppose Herodias trained her?&rdquo; He leaned forward
to glance past Antipas to the intent Tetrarchess who seemed
absorbed completely in her daughter&rsquo;s performance. &ldquo;What a
symphony of motion and movement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when that movement begins to gyrate in the region of
the hips, Centurion, you&rsquo;ll realize Salome&rsquo;s no longer a child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was the flowing, rhythmical motion long in attaining that
region. In synchronized rolling and lifting and falling, the right
shoulder joined the twisting, gently writhing arm, and then the
rounded stomach undulated, freed now of the teasing veils.
As the tempo of the music speeded and the volume swelled and
the throb of the drums grew deeper, the hips began their undulating
motion. Grinding, thrusting, withdrawing, thrusting, they
moved faster and faster in an abandon of voluptuous movement.
Then the music slowed again and the frenzied gyrations with it,
and quickly the movement ran downward from the stilled hips
and disappeared in a restrained tapping of bare toes on the mosaic
of the triclinium&rsquo;s marble floor.</p>
<p>The Tetrarch&rsquo;s guests, inspired by his shouted acclamations, applauded
wildly. And before they had settled to silence again,
Salome dextrously transferred to her right hand the thin veils
that throughout her dancing, even in the abandon of its most
voluptuous last moments, she had held clutched snugly against her
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
breasts, and lifted high her left arm as she extended her right foot.
Then she began anew the routine she had just finished; she followed
it, motion for motion, until in the midst of the most
lascivious portion of the dance she suddenly turned her back to
the Tetrarch and his company, and lowering her arm, without
missing one wanton movement of her writhing, weaving hips,
she thrust her arms, shoulder high, straight out to the sides. In
each hand, completely away from her perspiration-dampened, shimmering
white body, she clutched several of the bright-hued wisps
of silk.</p>
<p>From where the diners sat across the bright circle from her, the
girl appeared to be entirely nude, despite the thin bit of flesh-toned
silk that bound her loins. Her curling long black hair hanging unrestrained
down her back and across her shoulders added to the
illusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear daughter, don&rsquo;t you know that one never turns
his back upon the Tetrarch?&rdquo; Antipas shouted, as he leaned out
across the table, his black eyes bulging as though they might leap
from the sockets.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s only response was to draw in her hands slightly and
then thrust them outward again in the pantomime of unveiling
herself anew as, in an ecstasy of voluptuous simulations, she rotated
her slim hips to the mounting frenzy of the music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful! Wonderful!&rdquo; Antipas clapped his fat hands together.
&ldquo;Marvelous, my dear child! But must you continue to give
your back to the Tetrarch? Will you continue thus to tease us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Salome made no reply to her stepfather. But slowly, as
Antipas clutched the table edge to pull to his feet, the girl, without
breaking the rhythm of her seductive undulations, began
slowly to turn herself about, her arms still outthrust from her
sides. The Tetrarch, seeing it, let go his prop and sank heavily to
the couch; once more his screamed approval signaled the guests to
new applause, as every eye in eager anticipation followed the gracefully
suggestive motions of their royal host&rsquo;s stepdaughter.</p>
<p>But hardly had the girl done a quarter turn toward the diners
when suddenly she drew the gossamer scarves protectively to herself,
and, whirling the remainder of the turn to face them, paused
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
in her dancing. Then with head tossed back and laughing, she
scampered across the spotlighted circle almost to the Tetrarch&rsquo;s
table. A pace from it she stopped, turned her head, and with a
nod signaled the musicians. As they resumed the dancing rhythm,
she began again her voluptuous gyrations.</p>
<p>Claudia was close enough now to Salome to see that the girl&rsquo;s
half-closed eyes, peering through slits beneath the darkly shadowed
lids, were glancing from the Tetrarch to her mother beside him.
Salome, she was suddenly convinced, was performing for Antipas
not out of her own volition but through Herodias&rsquo; devising.
And what, Claudia wondered again, could the crafty Tetrarchess be
planning to accomplish through this brazen flaunting of her daughter&rsquo;s
physical charms.</p>
<p>But the Procurator&rsquo;s wife had only a moment for conjecture;
Salome suddenly ceased her rhythmical writhings and stepped
forward to lean above the Tetrarch&rsquo;s still burdened table. Teasingly,
and before the musicians were aware of her changed routine,
she fumbled with the veils still held pressed against her, and
as Antipas, in a new frenzy of excitement, sought to rise from his
couch, she thrust her hands apart and then, with a high squeal
of laughter, crossed them again in front of her. In the brief moment
that her youthful but fully matured bosom had been completely
exposed to them, the Tetrarch had lunged out to clutch
her, but he had shattered his wine goblet instead and the girl,
screaming with laughter, had darted backward into the illuminated
circle to evade him.</p>
<p>As a servant came running up to mop the spilled wine and remove
the broken glass, Antipas settled back on his couch. &ldquo;Aha!
The clever little vixen was too quick for me,&rdquo; he said, turning
to face his wife. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll....&rdquo; He said no more. Herodias,
Claudia saw, was unsmiling, grim. But evidently she hadn&rsquo;t meant
for Antipas to see her in such a mood, for quickly she affected
a cloaking smile. &ldquo;By the gods,&rdquo; she said to her husband, &ldquo;the
child is clever, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salome was now in the center of the bright light. The music
had died away as the leader awaited his new instructions. The girl
stood quietly facing the Tetrarch and his guests, the colored veils
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
clutched in her crossed hands as though she were trying to cover
herself in a chilling breeze. Then she turned her head and lifted
one veil-holding hand to signal resumption of the dance music;
the musicians swung quickly into a fast rhythm that sent Salome
dipping and prancing around the lighted circle. As she came
within inches of the Tetrarch&rsquo;s table, Antipas once more lunged
toward her, but she had anticipated his attempt to catch her and
had darted out of reach. Laughing, she danced to the center of
the lighted spot; soon she was whirling around on the balls of her
bare feet, and as the tempo of the drums and the strings and the
brasses increased and the volume swelled, she circled as she pirouetted.
Opposite the Centurion Cornelius she released one of
the veils and it sailed across the table to be caught by the diner
at his right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another!&rdquo; shouted Antipas as she whirled past his couch but
safely beyond his reach. &ldquo;Another! Let another one fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was wheeling before the diners at her mother&rsquo;s left when
she loosed a second veil; a man grabbed for it and thrust it beneath
his pillow. When she had spun around to the other side of the
circle she held out her arm and a yellow one sailed above the table.
A man and a woman grabbed for the floating gossamer; he caught
it but laughingly surrendered it to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More! More!&rdquo; screamed the Tetrarch, and around the square
of the tables others joined in chorus. And when the girl let two of
the shimmering scarves sail away together, they screamed again.
&ldquo;More! More! Let them fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salome, her head back, laughing, began now to tease the Tetrarch
and his guests. Whirling around the rim of the patch of
light, she would sweep one hand with its veils outward with a
flourish and then, without releasing them, fold the arm back
across the other one, which all the while she had kept pressed
close to her pirouetting white body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an actress, the little coquette!&rdquo; Cornelius observed. &ldquo;She
knows how to build up suspense. She understands how to please
Antipas, too; she&rsquo;s got a good sense of the dramatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and in another moment or so, unless I&rsquo;m entirely wrong
about her, her dramatics will have Antipas&mdash;and maybe you,
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
too&mdash;groveling.&rdquo; But quickly her expression changed to one of perplexity.
&ldquo;Still I wonder, Cornelius, what Herodias is scheming.
Surely she&rsquo;s getting no pleasure out of seeing her daughter make
a spectacle of herself in public. There must be something behind
it; yet I can&rsquo;t imagine what. What on earth could she want so
badly that she would go to such great...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her question remained unfinished, for the girl had pranced,
still pirouetting, into the center of the bright spot. She paused
in her turning and with both hands clutching the remaining veils
modestly across her chest, signaled with a motion of her head to
the leader of the musicians. Immediately the volume of the music
began to increase and the tempo to speed, and Salome whirled
faster and faster in time with the music&rsquo;s crescendo. As she spun
on the balls of her bare feet, the veils that had been hanging to
her knees streamed out in a kaleidoscope of whirling color. The
flutes more insistently joined their whining pleas to the deeper
invitations of the harps and the dulcimers and the rhythmical
throaty demands of the drums; the girl&rsquo;s black hair, standing out
from her head as she whirled, made a dark spinning disk above the
circular rainbow of the scarves.</p>
<p>Now Salome lifted one arm above her head, while she held the
other protectively before her, so that the dark whirling of her hair
had above it as well as beneath it a spinning rainbow of color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what she&rsquo;ll do next,&rdquo; Claudia said, leaning to
her right to speak to Cornelius above the steadily mounting volume
and frenzy of the music.</p>
<p>Antipas, too, must have anticipated it. &ldquo;The other arm!&rdquo; he
shouted, as he leaned forward, his eyes blazing with lechery. &ldquo;Raise
the other arm, my dear child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Salome did not obey the Tetrarch. Instead, as she came
pirouetting nearer him, she lowered the arm she had just raised,
and the two whirling circles of color merged into one fast, revolving
gossamer flame. Faster the girl spun, and faster, faster the musicians
played, and higher swelled their instruments&rsquo; invitation
to abandoned revelry.</p>
<p>Antipas, who had sat back when the girl failed to heed his demand,
reached for his goblet, gulped his wine, and was replacing
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
the slender-stemmed glass when suddenly Salome, whirling
hardly two paces from his table, lifted both arms high into the air.
The transparent veils twisted upward with them to form above
the girl&rsquo;s swirling black hair a spinning canopy of weaving and
shifting bright colors.</p>
<p>Once more the Tetrarch overturned his goblet, and the wine
spilled across the table. But when a servant came racing to his
aid, Antipas waved him away. The Tetrarch&rsquo;s amazed eyes had
focused upon the dancing girl; he would permit nothing to obstruct,
even for an instant, his view of her.</p>
<p>The spinning Salome in the circle of light from the wall lamp
was nude from the small gossamer triangle of her loins&rsquo; covering
to the crown of her head, and in the rapidity of her turning she
appeared to be entirely divested of clothing.</p>
<p>Antipas caught at the edge of the table and pushed himself,
swaying, to his feet. &ldquo;Nearer, child, nearer!&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;Come
closer! Come closer to us! Come....&rdquo; But his frenzied words
were choked in a swirling cloud of silken transparencies, for his
stepdaughter had let go all her veils and one had dipped full
into the flushed, round face of the Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea.</p>
<p>As Antipas struggled to free himself of the clinging, vision-obscuring
fluff of silk, the guests around the tables grabbed merrily
for the descending veils. But by the time the Tetrarch had jerked
the scarf away from his face, Salome had already disappeared; she
had darted across the spotlighted mosaic floor into the enfolding
privacy of the triclinium&rsquo;s antechamber. Behind her, her audience
thundered its applause.</p>
<p>Moments later, before the birthday celebrants had settled completely
from the excitement of her dramatic exit, Salome, dressed
as she had been when she left to prepare for her dance, returned
to the great chamber and took her place beside her mother.
Claudia, watching discreetly, saw the Tetrarchess lightly squeeze
the girl&rsquo;s hand and bend over to whisper into her ear.</p>
<p>Antipas sat up and beaming turned to face his stepdaughter.
&ldquo;My child, you have pleased the Tetrarch immensely,&rdquo; he said,
as he rubbed his plump hands together. &ldquo;I had no idea that you
could dance with such grace and charm. Your dancing has far
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
excelled the finest efforts of the women of Arabia; it has added
immeasurably to the pleasure of the Tetrarch and his guests.&rdquo; He
reached for his goblet, swallowed the wine, then wiped his mouth
with the back of his hand. &ldquo;And now, my dear daughter, you have
but to name your reward for thus having entertained so pleasantly
the Tetrarch and our friends. Speak out, Salome. What shall it
be? A palace of your own beside the sea? A great pleasure yacht
with servants in shining livery and galley slaves to row it? Perchance
a long visit to Rome to renew your friendships in the
capital, with a handsome allowance to cover every gift your fancy
may envision? Speak up, now. Let your wish be known, and it shall
be granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even, Sire, to the half of your tetrarchy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antipas blinked, hesitated a moment, and then his round face
brightened. &ldquo;Yes, if you ask it, even to the half of the tetrarchy,
though I should think a marble palace or a yacht....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, Sire,&rdquo; Salome interrupted. &ldquo;I wish not the half
of your tetrarchy or any part of it. Nor do I need or desire a
marble palace or a pleasure boat, or a trip at this time to Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I know what will please you,&rdquo; Antipas spoke up. &ldquo;A
new wardrobe, full of beautiful garments fashioned of the finest
silks brought from the Orient or woven on the looms in Phoenicia....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not gowns or shoes or houses or yachts or journeys to Rome
or gold and silver....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come, my dear child, you must be repaid for the pleasure
you have given us. I beg of you, name your any desire....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Tetrarch will grant it?&rdquo; Salome stood up, facing the
ruler of Galilee and Peraea, just beyond her mother. &ldquo;You swear it,
Sire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the beard of the High Priest, I swear it, Salome. I shall
grant whatever you ask of me, even to the half of the tetrarchy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Sire,&rdquo; she said, smiling demurely, &ldquo;my request is simple
and will rob the Tetrarch&rsquo;s treasury of not one denarius. It is my
wish&rdquo;&mdash;she paused and looked the happily smiling Antipas full
in his round face&mdash;&ldquo;that the Tetrarch present to me on a silver
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
platter the head of the Wilderness preacher called John the Baptizer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia and Cornelius had been leaning out over their plates,
avidly following the conversation of the girl and her stepfather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the gods!&rdquo; Claudia whispered, without taking her eyes
from the still calmly smiling Salome. &ldquo;Now I understand. Herodias,
by the Bountiful Mother....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she said no more, for Antipas was pulling to his feet.
&ldquo;Surely, child, I have not heard you correctly. Surely you would
not wish to have the head of a man....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you did hear correctly, Sire. And you have sworn to grant
me my wish. I ask only for the head of the Prophet John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tetrarch, braced against the table&rsquo;s edge, looked to his
right and then left along the tables. The eyes of his guests were
fastened on their plates; not one face was raised to help him. Antipas
stood, drained of all levity; the impact of the girl&rsquo;s inhuman
request, so simply and heartlessly presented, had sobered him. He
turned again to Salome and tried to affect a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you a man, a soldier, perhaps, seeking revenge upon an
enemy ... but for a beautiful young woman of such charm and
culture, who has danced for us so delightfully&rdquo;&mdash;he shook his head
sadly&mdash;&ldquo;such an utterly strange request for a beautiful woman.&rdquo;
He seemed to be thinking aloud, talking more to himself than to
the girl. &ldquo;To want the head of a prophet of Israel, a man held in
such esteem by so many of our Jewish subjects, a prophet who
may indeed have been sent of Israel&rsquo;s God....&rdquo; He broke off,
shaking his head as if in deep perplexity.</p>
<p>Claudia, watching Salome now, saw Herodias reach out and
gently grasp her daughter&rsquo;s arm. The girl, still standing, smiled
cynically and tossed her head. &ldquo;Nevertheless, Sire, that is my request.
If, however, the Tetrarch wishes to dishonor his oath before
this company and refuse me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tetrarch banged his fist on the table top. &ldquo;The Tetrarch
never dishonors an oath!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;He withdraws no promises
he makes.&rdquo; He turned to face the two guardsmen at the door, the
soldiers who had brought the Wilderness prophet into the banquet
room and had escorted him back to the dungeon. &ldquo;Guardsmen,
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
you have heard the request of the Princess Salome. Go you now
into the dungeon and carry out her request.&rdquo; He paused. They
stood stiffly at attention, awaiting his final command. &ldquo;Do you
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men glanced at one another, then faced the Tetrarch.
&ldquo;We understand, Sire,&rdquo; one said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly the two strode out of the chamber; their footsteps
echoed as they marched down the hall. Antipas slumped on his
couch, then lowered his head between his hands. Salome took
her seat. She smiled as she and her mother whispered. The guests
kept their places and were silent; the servants, moving about to
replenish the wine goblets, walked noiselessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tetrarch is making a monstrous mistake,&rdquo; Cornelius said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s giving in to Herodias?&rdquo; Claudia inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s ordering the prophet&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rdquo;&mdash;a faint smile crossed her face&mdash;&ldquo;are afraid of the
Jews&rsquo; one god?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could be,&rdquo; he answered unhesitatingly. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not my
reason. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s....&rdquo; He stopped. A servant had approached
the Tetrarch&rsquo;s couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Centurion Longinus?&rdquo; The Tetrarch raised his bulky frame
to a sitting position. &ldquo;Indeed, bring him to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of the Tetrarch&rsquo;s words, Claudia looked up; her
eyes followed the retreating servant. Antipas turned to her. &ldquo;The
Centurion Longinus has just arrived at Machaerus,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
sent for him. Shall we make a place for him between you and
Centurion Cornelius perhaps, my dear?&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;He must
be famished from the long journey to this forsaken outpost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the servant escorted the centurion to the
Tetrarch&rsquo;s couch. Antipas greeted him cordially, presented him
to the diners, and ordered the servants to set him a place at the
table. When after a minute he was settled beside her, Claudia
found his hand on the couch and squeezed it hard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so wonderful
to have you here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can hardly wait to hear
the news from Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly wait to be with you ... alone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
been so long, and I had no idea I&rsquo;d find you here.&rdquo; He turned to
Cornelius at his right. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got much to tell you, Centurion,&rdquo;
he announced, &ldquo;and, no doubt, much to hear from you too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what on earth are you doing at Machaerus, Longinus?
Where have you been before this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiberias,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I came there after landing at Caesarea.
I had orders from Sejanus to convey to the Tetrarch. When I
reached Tiberias and found that he and his guests had departed
for Machaerus, I set out to follow. It was urgent that I see the
Tetrarch as quickly as possible; I didn&rsquo;t dare await his return to
his palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antipas had overheard. &ldquo;We are happy that you came, Centurion,
but what mission could you have that would be so urgent?&rdquo;
He smiled, and his manner was most agreeable. &ldquo;A new style of
glassware, perhaps, that you wish to sell to the Tetrarch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sire, nothing to sell you ... now, at any rate. It&rsquo;s a more
important mission. I&rsquo;m coming to you from the Prefect Sejanus
who is sending you instructions in the name of the Emperor, for
whom he is acting in this case and after conferring with Tiberius
at Capri. I assure you it is important and urgent, and I desire
an audience with you at the first moment you may be available,
Sire, in order to transmit to you the instructions from Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Centurion&rdquo;&mdash;the Tetrarch&rsquo;s flippant manner had disappeared;
his countenance, at the centurion&rsquo;s mention of Sejanus
and the Emperor, was suddenly grave&mdash;&ldquo;if it is that urgent, we can
leave the dining chamber at once. But that would cause a lot of
talk, I suppose. Must you confer with me in secret, Centurion?
These are all dear friends, my wife, the Procurator&rsquo;s wife, Centurion
Cornelius. Is it necessary that the information you bring
me from Rome be kept from them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no, Sire. In fact, they would know soon anyway, as
quickly as you acted. And the Prefect desires that you act immediately.&rdquo;
He paused. Antipas nodded. &ldquo;In fact, Sire, it is fortunate
that you are here at Machaerus; your orders can be put
into effect within minutes after they have been issued. The Prefect&rsquo;s
instructions to you have to do with that strange fellow we
encountered along the Jordan as we were going to Tiberias, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
one you had arrested and brought here to be imprisoned, you
remember, the Wilderness prophet called John the Baptizer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John the Baptizer!&rdquo; The Tetrarch&rsquo;s face had paled. Herodias,
who had been listening, leaned forward; her countenance was a
mask. &ldquo;But what of John,&rdquo; the Tetrarch began, &ldquo;what...?&rdquo; He
paused, licked his dry lips, and swallowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire, it&rsquo;s nothing to be unduly concerned about,&rdquo; Longinus
replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a policy matter. You know that Sejanus and
Tiberius are always stressing the importance of keeping the Jews
happy, at least to the extent that they won&rsquo;t attempt to revolt.
And since John is so popular among them, the Prefect believes
that your release of the prophet will be pleasing to the Jews and
will, to that extent, strengthen Rome&rsquo;s rule ... and the Tetrarch&rsquo;s.
There&rsquo;s no point in needlessly offending them, you see.
That&rsquo;s why he sent me to you with the suggestion, Sire, that you
release John at once. He has prepared notices, to be signed by
you, for posting in Tiberias, Jerusalem, Caesarea....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tetrarch said nothing but buried his face in his hands.
Herodias, erect and unmoving, stared straight ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Sire....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus said no more, for Claudia had suddenly grasped his
arm. He turned and stared toward the doorway through which, a
moment before the centurion&rsquo;s arrival, the two palace guardsmen
had disappeared. Now the two were returning. They advanced
straight toward the Tetrarch. One man was carrying, chest high
and at arms&rsquo; length, a large silver tray of the type used by servants
at Machaerus for serving food. On the tray was a rounded,
gory mass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that can&rsquo;t be for me, surely,&rdquo; Longinus whispered to her.
&ldquo;It looks like raw meat, bloody.... Great Jove!&rdquo; The man bearing
the tray had come close enough for them to see his ghastly
offering. &ldquo;By all the great and little gods!&rdquo; He twisted to face the
girl, his expression suddenly aghast. His voice, when at last he
spoke, was hoarse and unbelieving. &ldquo;The Wilderness prophet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded. &ldquo;Yes, the Tetrarch had him beheaded ... just
a moment ago, perhaps even after you arrived here.&rdquo; She turned
her head to look away from the guardsman&rsquo;s horrifying burden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>But Longinus saw. The prophet&rsquo;s head, with blood dripping
from the stump of the severed neck, lay on one ear in the tangled,
gore-smeared mat of his long, black hair. His beard, too, was blood-streaked,
and his face and forehead were smeared; blood had run
down into the corners of his eyes. Wide-open and set in staring
rigidity, the eyes seemed to be trying to communicate with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; the guardsmen said, as he reached the table and held out
the profaned tray, &ldquo;the Tetrarch&rsquo;s orders have been carried out.
The head of the desert preacher....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; screamed Antipas, as he held up his right hand before
his eyes and pointed with the other toward his wife and her
daughter. &ldquo;Not here! It&rsquo;s ... it&rsquo;s theirs! Put it there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guardsman set the tray down in front of Salome, who
glanced at it idly and then lowered her head. Herodias stared
unabashed at the pitiful profanation before them, and then after
a moment she, too, looked away.</p>
<p>Now the Tetrarch lowered his shielding hand and calmly turned
to his left to face Herodias and his stepdaughter. His demeanor,
Longinus saw, was suddenly changed. When he spoke his voice
was calm, modulated. &ldquo;The Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea does
not dishonor a promise made,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My daughter, you have
the reward you sought. Now what will you do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned to stare an instant at her questioner. Then she
glanced again toward the head on the tray. Shock, nausea, sudden
fear, horror curdled her countenance, and she threw up a protecting
hand to shut out the fearful sight. &ldquo;Give it to Mother!&rdquo;
she cried out, her voice shrill, and tense. Jumping to her feet, she
fled from the great chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it away!&rdquo; Herodias screamed to a servant at her elbow.
&ldquo;Dispose of it ... quickly!&rdquo; Without a word to her husband,
she reached for her wine goblet and drank; then she drew up her
feet, smoothed the skirt of her glistening stola, and settled herself
comfortably on her elbow.</p>
<p>Equally calm, Antipas leaned over to speak to Longinus. &ldquo;I regret,
Centurion, that you didn&rsquo;t reach Machaerus a few minutes
earlier. But....&rdquo; He gestured with resignation, then sat back
on his couch. He was reaching for his wine glass when a palace
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
servant approached, bowing. The Tetrarch nodded to him. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire, a delegation has just arrived; the men declare they were
sent by King Aretas. They maintain their mission is most urgent
and they petition&mdash;indeed, Sire, they demand&mdash;that the Tetrarch
give them audience this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From King Aretas?&rdquo; A heavy scowl darkened the Tetrarch&rsquo;s
full, round face. &ldquo;Most urgent, they say?&rdquo; He was thoughtfully
silent a moment. Then he turned, glaring, to the obeisant servant.
&ldquo;Then bring them to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Sire&rdquo;&mdash;the bowing man was rubbing his hands together
nervously, palpably fearful&mdash;&ldquo;they suggested that perhaps the
Tetrarch would wish to receive them privately in his council
chamber....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Who are they to tell the Tetrarch where he must receive
them! Bring them to us, at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sire. Yes, immediately.&rdquo; The timorous fellow was backing
away, bowing, as he rubbed his knuckles in his palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what the servant said?&rdquo; Claudia whispered to
Longinus, as the Tetrarch twisted his heavy hulk the other way to
watch the retreating fellow. &ldquo;I wonder....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so do I. And I&rsquo;m sure Herodias does, too.&rdquo; He turned to
speak to Cornelius on his right. &ldquo;You heard the servant?&rdquo; Cornelius
nodded. &ldquo;Sounds like more trouble for the Tetrarch, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised,&rdquo; Cornelius agreed. &ldquo;This seems to be
a bad night for the old fellow, a tough night, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The representatives of the Arabian king were formally polite,
rigidly reserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no pleasant mission on which we have been sent here, O
Tetrarch Herod,&rdquo; the spokesman of the visiting Arabians announced,
once they had been presented to Antipas, &ldquo;and we regret
that we must speak as we have been ordered to speak, Sire,
and particularly that ears other than the Tetrarch&rsquo;s will hear the
message we have been commanded to bring you from His Majesty,
King Aretas. But the Tetrarch has so ordered it, and we must
obey.&rdquo; He paused, and from the fold of his robe pulled forth a
rolled document.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, speak,&rdquo; Antipas told him. &ldquo;The Tetrarch wishes on his
birthday&rdquo;&mdash;he affected a grim smile&mdash;&ldquo;that nothing be withheld
from his beloved wife and his guests. The Tetrarch is prepared
to hear the King&rsquo;s message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded, and unrolled the document. &ldquo;Sire, I have here
the King&rsquo;s message to the Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea. But
would not the Tetrarch prefer to have it read to him privately and
then later, if the Tetrarch might still wish it, have it read to this
assembled group?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it, now. Go on with it. Let us all hear the King&rsquo;s message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Sire.&rdquo; He bowed and then, shifting his position so
that the light from the wall lamps fell more directly on the parchment,
held it out from him and began to read. But when the stiffly
formal greeting was concluded, he raised his eyes questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Continue,&rdquo; said the Tetrarch.</p>
<p>The man nodded, and once more his eyes returned to the out-held
document. &ldquo;&lsquo;King Aretas declares that the Tetrarch Herod
Antipas in sending his faithful wife, the King&rsquo;s beloved daughter,
a bill of divorcement, after having deprived her of the honors and
privileges of the Tetrarchess of Galilee and Peraea, which honors
and privileges without right he conferred upon her successor, has
grievously injured and insulted the King&rsquo;s daughter, his royal
house, and the person of the King himself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia gently squeezed Longinus&rsquo; hand beside hers on the
couch, but she dared venture no whisper. Slyly, though, they both
glanced toward Herodias who sat eying the Arabian, a malevolent,
frozen smile on her plainly flushed face.</p>
<p>The reader looked up again, but only for an instant, and then
resumed his reading of the Arabian ruler&rsquo;s grievances. &ldquo;&lsquo;Now,
therefore&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;he cleared his throat&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;King Aretas demands that
the Tetrarch Herod Antipas seek to make what amends he can
by providing certain reparations to King Aretas, the terms of which
shall be agreed upon in conference of the Tetrarch and his ministers
with the King&rsquo;s ministers who bear this message. But King
Aretas further demands that before such negotiations are entered
into, the Tetrarch Herod Antipas must put away or reduce to second
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
wife the woman he now calls Tetrarchess and restore to her
rightful place as Tetrarchess and first wife the King&rsquo;s beloved
daughter. He further demands....&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>He</i> demands!&rsquo; Everything is &lsquo;<i>He</i> demands&rsquo;!&rdquo; Herodias had
sprung to her feet, her eyes blazing, her shaking finger extended
across the table toward the suddenly interrupted Arabian. Now
she turned fiercely upon the Tetrarch. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear him, O
Tetrarch? &lsquo;<i>He</i> demands!&rsquo; That old goat of Arabia demands of you,
Herod, Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea. He writes you an evil, insulting
message abusing you and your wife, and you sit here calmly
listening while that man reads it before these your guests and me
your Tetrarchess....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my beloved Herodias&rdquo;&mdash;Antipas clutched the table&rsquo;s edge
as he straggled to get to his feet&mdash;&ldquo;these men are only the messengers
of King Aretas. What you hear are not this man&rsquo;s words,
they are the King&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I know that, Antipas; I am not entirely a fool. I
know they are the King&rsquo;s words, but don&rsquo;t they say that Aretas has
empowered these men to represent him in your negotiations over
me? Over me, do you hear? Negotiations designed to force me
from the palace in Tiberias, to return <i>her</i>....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gently Antipas caught his wife&rsquo;s arm and tried to calm her, to
get her to take her seat. &ldquo;Of course not, my dear, of course you&rsquo;ll
not be sent away, you&rsquo;ll never be supplanted....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She jerked her arm free, turned upon him, eyes blazing now in
utter fury. &ldquo;Then send them back to her doting old father! Send
them packing, Antipas!&rdquo; She shook her finger under his nose. &ldquo;Or
else, by all the great and little gods, I myself will go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antipas faced the still shocked Arabian. &ldquo;Perhaps you had best
excuse yourself,&rdquo; he said evenly. &ldquo;Tomorrow, in the calm of our
council chamber, we shall be able....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; shouted Herodias. &ldquo;Let them leave tonight, immediately.
I can abide their insulting presence here no longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tetrarch, ignoring his wife&rsquo;s outburst, beckoned to a servant
hovering nearby. &ldquo;Escort these men into a suitable chamber, and
see that they are adequately provided for with our best food and
wine,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;and after they have dined, show them to
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
their bedchambers. They must be in need of replenishment and
rest after their arduous journey to Machaerus.&rdquo; He bowed to the
delegation&rsquo;s leader. &ldquo;We shall defer further consideration of the
matter until the morning. We are all greatly fatigued and agitated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant stepped forward and bowed to the visitors. They in
turn, without any further word from their spokesman, bowed to
the Tetrarch and turned with the escorting servant to withdraw
from the triclinium.</p>
<p>Herodias, seated now and apparently calm, twisted around to
watch them depart. But when at the doorway Aretas&rsquo; spokesman
glanced over his shoulder toward the Tetrarch, she suddenly
grabbed the goblet beside her plate. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;Go!
Go!&rdquo; With all her strength she hurled the goblet toward the man;
it shattered on the wall near the door. As a servant came running
to pick up the broken bits of glass, she sank to the couch, pulled
up her sandaled feet, and, sobbing wildly, buried her face in the
pillow.</p>
<h2 title=""><span class="sc">Judaea</span></h2>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<h2 id="c32">32</h2>
<p>The Tetrarch&rsquo;s caravan had reached the flatland where the narrow
Plain of Esdraelon pushing eastward between Mount Gilboa and
Little Hermon touched the Jordan valley. There Longinus and
Claudia had taken leave of the returning group.</p>
<p>Cornelius had wanted to send a detail of guardsmen to escort
them the remainder of the way to Caesarea. &ldquo;You never know
when one of these zealot gangs may come swooping down on
you,&rdquo; he had protested to Longinus. &ldquo;And if the Emperor&rsquo;s stepdaughter
should be captured, with Senator Piso&rsquo;s son, and held for
ransom ... well, by Jove, Longinus, you can imagine the uproar
there&rsquo;d be in Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Longinus had refused the offer. He had assured Cornelius
that their little party, he, Claudia, and the two servants she had
brought with her, would join the first caravan headed toward
Caesarea; until one came along they would remain at the nearby
inn.</p>
<p>Though the Tetrarch&rsquo;s parting words had been polite, he had
seemed deeply meditative, still mired in the haze of introspection
into which the startling twist of his birthday celebration had
plunged him. Nor had the results of his meeting the next day with
the representatives of King Aretas enlivened him, for though he
had yielded nothing to his former father-in-law&rsquo;s demands, he
knew that the Arabians had departed in a bitter mood that for
him boded no good. That this unfortunate series of events was
known to two Roman centurions and the Procurator&rsquo;s wife, and
particularly to Longinus, who had come to Machaerus on a mission
from the Prefect Sejanus whose accomplishment had been
so disastrously thwarted by the Tetrarch himself, made the situation
all the more distressing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Herodias, on the other hand, apparently had recovered completely
from the loss of presence suffered at the Tetrarch&rsquo;s banquet.
She spoke with her usual polished ease. &ldquo;Soon you must visit
us again at Tiberias, my dear,&rdquo; she said to Claudia, as the Tetrarch&rsquo;s
caravan prepared to resume its journey, &ldquo;and bring Longinus
to protect you from our plundering zealots.&rdquo; She smiled
pertly. &ldquo;Longinus, help her arrange it. Let&rsquo;s try to get together in
Jerusalem, perhaps during the Feast of Tabernacles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had ridden at once to the inn, which sat at the edge of
the road that led from the Jordan ford straight westward past
Mount Gilboa to the Samaria highroad from Galilee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will require two rooms,&rdquo; Longinus told the proprietor, a
beak-nosed Jew with an unkempt, wine-stained beard. &ldquo;The manservant
will wish to sleep near the horses; if there is a place in the
stables....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, soldier&rdquo;&mdash;the innkeeper had observed immediately that his
guest was wearing a Roman military uniform&mdash;&ldquo;he can bed down
comfortably there. And for you and your wife&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, questioning,
and Longinus nodded&mdash;&ldquo;one of the larger chambers, yes,
and for the maid a smaller one, adjoining yours, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not be necessary that it adjoin ours; wherever you can
conveniently place her will be satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So a small room down the narrow hallway from theirs had been
assigned to Tullia, and now the maid had retired to it, and the
manservant to a mat at the stable. Claudia and Longinus had supper
and, fatigued from the journey down from Machaerus to the
Jericho plain, they retired to their chamber.</p>
<p>Longinus, seated on a low stool, was unbuckling his sandals. &ldquo;I
do hope a caravan for Caesarea comes along soon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
anxious to get there; I&rsquo;m almost tempted to venture the journey
on our own. But with so many of those zealots in the hills....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have tired of me this quickly, you can&rsquo;t wait to return
me to the Procurator?&rdquo; she asked innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting tired of returning you <i>to</i> the Procurator,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after every time with you I&rsquo;m more loath to go back to
him myself.&rdquo; The mask of innocence was gone; she was entirely
serious now. &ldquo;Longinus, isn&rsquo;t there something we can do, some
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
solution? We simply can&rsquo;t go on like this indefinitely.&rdquo; She had
finished undressing; walking over to the bed, she pulled down
the cover, slid beneath it, and pulled it up to her chin. &ldquo;By all
the gods, Longinus, there must be a better fate for us. Surely the
granddaughter of an Emperor, the stepdaughter of another Emperor....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s exactly why there is a problem,&rdquo; he interrupted.
&ldquo;If you were just a Roman equestrian, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been
forced to marry Pilate in the first place.&rdquo; He kicked off one of
his sandals and twisted about to face her. &ldquo;Claudia, you could
slip away from him and we could go away somewhere, but that
would hardly be a solution, though for me certainly it would be
a permanent one.&rdquo; He smiled vapidly. &ldquo;Also you could ask Tiberius&mdash;and
that means, of course, Sejanus, too&mdash;to permit you to
divorce him; I hardly think, however, that they would allow you
to do it, and then the situation would be worse than it is now;
they would watch us all the more and doubtless send us to separate
far distance provinces, the gods only know where.&rdquo; He considered
a moment. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the possibility, though&mdash;probability, I
hope&mdash;that Pilate will soon do something that will so infuriate
Sejanus that he will depose him as Procurator and perhaps banish
him to another remote province. Then they might allow you to
divorce him and marry me, provided we went off to Gaul or&rdquo;&mdash;he
shrugged&mdash;&ldquo;Britannia or Hispania or some other faraway place.
But I&rsquo;m not sure of that.&rdquo; He removed the other sandal and placed
it beside the first one. &ldquo;That is probably our best chance, Claudia,
maybe our only one as long as Tiberius and Sejanus stay in power.
But even then I can&rsquo;t proceed too fast against Pilate, because then
Sejanus would surely suspect that you and I....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t he think already that you want to marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first he did, I suspect. But now I think he&rsquo;s convinced that
our interest in each other is ... well, a purely physical one. And
Antipas, I&rsquo;m sure, has the same notion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly Antipas isn&rsquo;t likely to cause us trouble. He&rsquo;s in
enough trouble himself to keep occupied with his own affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Between Sejanus and Aretas he&rsquo;s likely to be very busy for
the next few months. And that gets me back&mdash;after you started me
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
on another tack&mdash;to why I&rsquo;m so eager to be in Caesarea. I&rsquo;ve got to
get off a report to Sejanus. I want him to hear from me what happened
at Machaerus before someone else gets the chance to tell
him. He may think my dallying allowed Antipas to behead the
Wilderness fellow, and also he may wonder why I didn&rsquo;t prevent
the trouble between Antipas and Aretas from coming to such an
acute crisis. So I want to get my report off as quickly as possible,
do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do understand. You&rsquo;re quite right, it&rsquo;s very important. I
wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Antipas got into a war with Aretas because
of Herodias. And that would bring the Roman legionaries
into the fighting, of course, and surely Pilate would be drawn in,
and you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very probably, yes. Certainly it would involve Pilate sooner or
later. And, of course, the Legate Vitellius would be implicated.
Sejanus will certainly call on him to defend Galilee should Aretas
attack Antipas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Tetrarch&rsquo;s marrying Herodias may ruin him ... and
Pilate, too,&rdquo; Claudia said thoughtfully. She lay, head back, watching
him finish his preparations for bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sound as though you hope it will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stretched herself seductively under the light covering.
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Her quick smile revealed a suddenly changed mood. &ldquo;But
for tonight at least let&rsquo;s think no more of Antipas or Pilate. Tomorrow
perhaps there&rsquo;ll be a caravan along, and we&rsquo;ll be starting
for Caesarea.&rdquo; Gingerly she turned down the covering beside her
and held out white, bare arms to him. &ldquo;Hurry, Longinus,&rdquo; she
said softly. &ldquo;The night is wasting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<h2 id="c33">33</h2>
<p>Well ahead of his caravan returning to the palace at Tiberias raced
the startling and, to many, the highly provocative report of the
Tetrarch&rsquo;s beheading of John the Baptist in fulfillment of a rash
promise made to his wife&rsquo;s dancing daughter.</p>
<p>The delegation that had gone down to Machaerus to intercede
for the prophet&rsquo;s release had brought back the tragic news; quickly
the story had spread to Jerusalem and to Ophel, the teeming
Lower City into which countless poor were squalidly compressed,
and beyond there on past the villages of Judaea and Samaria, all
the way down into Galilee. Along the shores of the little sea and
in many a huddle of modest homes, and here and there in the
pretentious houses of the rich, Israelites were shaking their heads
sadly and muttering imprecations upon the Idumaean ruler of
Galilee and Peraea.</p>
<p>With the account of the Wilderness prophet&rsquo;s execution went
the story, too, of how King Aretas of Arabia had sent his couriers
to Machaerus to threaten Herod Antipas with war because of the
Tetrarch&rsquo;s having divorced the King&rsquo;s daughter and made her supplanter
Herodias his Tetrarchess. Soon rumors began to spread
that war with Aretas was imminent and that the Arabian ruler was
likely any day to bring his army surging across the borders of Israel
to punish his former son-in-law.</p>
<p>Even before the arrival at Caesarea of Claudia and Longinus, the
stories from Machaerus had reached the Procurator Pontius Pilate.
Their lateness, she explained to Pilate, had been unavoidable; they
had waited to join a caravan journeying westward rather than risk
the hazards of traveling with only two servants through a region
frequented by robbers and zealot revolutionaries.</p>
<p>Pilate appeared to accept without reservation her explanation;
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
he indicated in no way that he might be jealous of the centurion.
His attitude exasperated Claudia all the more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be that stupid,&rdquo; she fumed one day to Tullia, with
whom she had long come to talk frankly and in utter confidence.
&ldquo;He surely knows about Longinus and me. Yet if he&rsquo;s in the least
bit jealous of the centurion, he&rsquo;s careful not to let me know. It&rsquo;s
insulting, Tullia, his indifference to me. It&rsquo;s humiliating. Why do
you suppose he acts that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are the stepdaughter of the Emperor, Mistress. What
could he do, even though he is the Procurator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could be a man!&rdquo; Claudia snapped. &ldquo;He could kill Longinus,
or try to, and give me a lashing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid shook her head. &ldquo;No, Mistress, not even a Procurator
would dare lay a hand on you, or anyone for whom you held high
regard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m his wife, Tullia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you are also the Emperor&rsquo;s stepdaughter, Mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately upon their return to Caesarea from Machaerus,
Longinus had prepared a comprehensive report to Sejanus in which
he related the unfortunate events that had come to such a dramatic
climax at the Tetrarch&rsquo;s birthday banquet. The message was
dispatched to Rome on an Alexandrian grain ship that had paused
for a day in the harbor at Caesarea.</p>
<p>In the several weeks that followed he saw little of Claudia. During
that period he went on a mission for Sergius Paulus to Jerusalem
and upon his return took command while Sergius was away
at Antioch in response to a summons from the Legate Vitellius,
who commanded the Roman forces in that entire eastern region.
Sergius, Longinus was sure, had been ordered to Antioch because
of the Arabian king&rsquo;s threat to attack Herod Antipas. The Legate,
he reasoned, was planning to have his forces ready for action in
the event that Aretas should challenge Rome by sending his army
against the Tetrarch. The centurion presumed that Vitellius had
summoned all military leaders stationed in Galilee&mdash;and possibly
even the Tetrarch himself&mdash;to meet him at Antioch. Longinus
learned that his guesswork had been correct; the meeting had
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
been held, and the Legate, Sergius said, had been blunt in his
conversations with the Tetrarch.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Caesarea garrison commander resumed his post,
a message from Senator Piso for his son arrived. It instructed Longinus
to set out as quickly as he could for the glassworks. Production
had decreased, and the quality of the ware being manufactured
was deteriorating. Morale among the slaves, his father
reported, seemed at its lowest point. Longinus was to do whatever
might be necessary to speed up the plant&rsquo;s production and improve
the quality of the glassware. The Prefect, his father added,
was in complete concurrence with these instructions. A fresh supply
of slaves, said the senator, was being sent out to Phoenicia by
the Prefect; the slaves were being shipped aboard a government
trireme that was leaving Rome within a week after the vessel bearing
this letter would sail for Joppa. Longinus, the letter suggested,
might even go aboard this letter-bearing vessel when it put in at
Caesarea.</p>
<p>Little had happened in Rome since his departure for Palestine,
his father reported. The Emperor was still at Capri, and Sejanus
was directing the government of the Empire. His mother sent her
love; she was quite well, though of late she had been disturbed at
the indisposition of her little Maltese dog. But the animal, thanks
be to Jove and the patient ministrations of Longinus&rsquo; mother, was
now recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to achieve as quickly as possible a new production record
at the glassworks,&rdquo; his father concluded. The Prefect was keeping
an eye on the figures, and it would be good business to earn the
Prefect&rsquo;s early approval. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spare the slaves; they are the
cheapest item in the operational cost; replacements can be made
quickly available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes scanned the letter, hardly seeing the words. Ever the
patrician Romans, his parents ... his mother concerned with
the indisposition of that pampered, silken-haired pet, his father
thinking only of pleasing Sejanus and building up for the Prefect
and himself more millions of sesterces. Don&rsquo;t spare the slaves; the
life of a slave is the cheapest item in the production of beautiful
glassware for the tables of patrician Rome and Alexandria and
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
Antioch and Athens. Work them until they fall dead, and heave
them into the flaming furnaces.</p>
<p>Longinus thought of the old slave. What would Cornelius think
of his father&rsquo;s letter, his father&rsquo;s philosophy? But Cornelius&rsquo; father,
too, is of the equestrian class; perhaps he shares the views of
Senator Piso. Cornelius, of course, would disapprove. He would
say that men are not the cheapest items in the making of glassware
or anything else. He would hold with the Galilean carpenter
that every man, Roman senator or Gallic slave or black savage from
Ethiopia, is a son of that jealous Yahweh of the Jews and possessor
of an immortal spirit.</p>
<p>And I, suddenly thought Longinus, do I hold with my father or
with Cornelius and the Galilean?</p>
<p>The day after Herod&rsquo;s birthday banquet Cornelius had related
to him in dramatic detail what he contended was the Galilean&rsquo;s
miraculous healing of Lucian, but Longinus had shrugged off his
friend&rsquo;s fervor with the observation that once more, as in the case
of Chuza&rsquo;s son, the clever carpenter from Nazareth had successfully
judged the hour at which the fever would break.</p>
<p>Of course his urbane, affluent father, rather than his Jewish-influenced
friend the centurion and the Galilean mystic, was right.
Even without using a stylus and tablet one can prove that a slave
is the cheapest of the several things involved in the making of
fine glassware; his father&rsquo;s statement to that effect was quickly
demonstrable. And yet....</p>
<p>Longinus shrugged and put away the letter. The ship, he discovered
some moments later, would be at the Caesarea port only
long enough to load supplies and freight; it would sail for Tyre
within four or five hours.</p>
<p>He packed quickly and sent his bags to the dock to be put
aboard. Then he rushed to the Procurator&rsquo;s Palace to tell Pilate
and his wife good-by. Happily, the Procurator had gone out. But
Longinus could have only a few minutes with Claudia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be up in Phoenicia long,&rdquo; he reassured her. &ldquo;It
shouldn&rsquo;t take many days before I get the operation of the plant
reorganized. And even before I finish the task, if I find it takes
longer than I now think it will, I may be able to board a vessel
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
and come down here for a visit. Claudia, why couldn&rsquo;t you arrange
a journey&rdquo;&mdash;his tone was eager&mdash;&ldquo;over to Tiberias for another stay
in the Tetrarch&rsquo;s Palace? That is, if in the meantime&rdquo;&mdash;his grin
lightened the tenseness of the moment&mdash;&ldquo;Aretas hasn&rsquo;t driven
him and Herodias away? But if they&rsquo;re still around, well, then I
could just by chance select that same time to visit Cornelius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he could stay with her no longer she summoned the
palace sedan-chair bearers and rode with him down to the dock.
After he had embarked and the ship was moving across the harbor
to gain the open sea beyond the long breakwater, she stepped
again into the sedan chair and was borne to the palace.</p>
<h2 id="c34">34</h2>
<p>But the biting, sharp winds of spring, sweeping down from the
mountains of Judah across the lower Shefelah and the region of
the coast, had subsided into the still and enervating heat of summer,
and the Centurion Longinus had not yet returned to his post.</p>
<p>Nor had Claudia received any message from him. Sergius Paulus,
too, had heard nothing, as she found when on several occasions
she had discreetly inquired about the centurion. The Procurator&rsquo;s
wife began to wonder if Longinus had been recalled to Rome and
sent away by Sejanus on a mission to some remote province of the
Empire, perhaps even as far, the gods forbid, as Brittania.</p>
<p>Then one day in late summer Cornelius appeared at the Procurator&rsquo;s
Palace. Pilate, it happened, had ridden down the coast
to Joppa; Claudia and the centurion could talk freely. Hardly were
they seated on the terrace overlooking the Great Sea when she
confronted him, eyes solemnly inquiring, her forehead wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cornelius, what can have happened to Longinus? I haven&rsquo;t
had a word from him or concerning him since he left here for the
glassworks so many weeks ago. I can&rsquo;t understand....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no cause to be worried,&rdquo; he interrupted, laughing. &ldquo;He
is still at the glassworks, or at any rate he was when I was there
recently. He&rsquo;s been working hard. The plant had deteriorated considerably;
he said it required more work than he had anticipated
to restore its operation to normal. He&rsquo;s been hoping all along to
get back to Caesarea to see you, but he just hasn&rsquo;t had the opportunity.
And he thought it best not to send any written messages;
unfortunately, there&rsquo;s been no one coming this way with whom
he dared entrust a spoken one ... except for me, of course. He
gave me a message for you, but I&rsquo;ve been delayed getting here. He
thinks you heard from him weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was the message he sent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I&rsquo;ve told you.&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;That he was well, working
hard, and hoped he would soon be in position to return to
Caesarea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should there have been more?&rdquo; His eyes were teasing. &ldquo;Yes, he
said to tell you that as far as he was concerned, nothing has
changed. He&rsquo;s still looking to the future. Is that the message you
sought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and expected. And should you see him before I do, you
may tell him that my message to him is the same. But, Cornelius&rdquo;&mdash;her
expression suddenly was earnest, almost pained&mdash;&ldquo;things
move so slowly; the future seems so far ahead, and the waiting is
so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not, Claudia. Maybe just around the turn of the road
you&rsquo;ll....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can see no turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The situation out here just now is so explosive that any moment
could bring great changes,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;and overnight the
problem you and Longinus have could be solved. Pilate and Herod
both could lose their favored positions and, conceivably, their
heads. And speaking of Herod reminds me that I was to give
you another message, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From whom, Herodias?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants me to return with you to Tiberias?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that. But she does want you to meet her in Jerusalem
in October at the Feast of Tabernacles. Pilate undoubtedly will go
again this year, and Herod too; after beheading the Wilderness
prophet and possibly involving Galilee in a war with Aretas, Antipas
will surely want to go up to the Temple to worship the
Jewish Yahweh; it&rsquo;s the only way left&mdash;aside from dropping Herodias&mdash;for
him to strengthen himself with his subjects.&rdquo; He paused
and leaned forward, smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to take my century up to
Jerusalem, Claudia, as I do on all such occasions when multitudes
of Jews assemble there, and I&rsquo;ll try to bring Longinus over to
Tiberias to make the journey to Jerusalem with me. If you&rsquo;ll
promise to join us there, I&rsquo;m sure I can promise you I&rsquo;ll have the
centurion with me when I come.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c35">35</h2>
<p>Almost overnight Jerusalem had been transformed.</p>
<p>Through the long drought of the summer months the ancient
city had grown more drab with the deepening of fine dust upon
its houses, its public buildings, and even upon the resplendent
Temple itself.</p>
<p>But now, with the coming of autumn and the annual great
Feast of Tabernacles, Jerusalem had bloomed into a veritable forest
of greenery. As far as Claudia could see from her perch high on a
balcony of the Tower of Antonia&mdash;down into the adjoining
Temple area, along the terraced rise of Mount Zion, southward
to sweltering Ophel and beyond the always smoking gehenna of
Hinnom&rsquo;s vale to the bluffs above it on the Bethlehem road, and
eastward past the Brook Kidron and the Garden of Gethsemane
up the slope of the Mount of Olives&mdash;stretched an almost unbroken
canopy of green boughs now beginning to wilt. Balconies,
roof tops, the grounds about the Temple walls, every unfilled
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
small plot of the cluttered soil of Jewry&rsquo;s holy city, were covered
with these improvised, temporary dwellings.</p>
<p>The Feast of Tabernacles, Tullia had explained to her mistress,
was the Hebrew festival marking the end of the harvesting season
and the early beginning of the rains. It was an occasion of national
thanksgiving to Yahweh, one that commemorated the Israelites&rsquo;
years of wandering in the desert wilderness where, after their escape
from Egyptian bondage, under the leadership of their great law-giver
Moses, they had dwelt in booths&mdash;they called them tabernacles&mdash;made
of branches hastily woven together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to this day,&rdquo; Tullia had concluded, &ldquo;in accordance with
the instructions in our sacred writings, every Jew during the Feast
of Tabernacles must leave his house and for eight days live in a
hut made of the branches of pine or myrtle or olive or palm.&rdquo;
The festival occasion, she further pointed out, was one of rejoicing
for Yahweh&rsquo;s deliverance of His children from slavery and His
establishment of them in their promised land. To honor Yahweh,
the celebrants would offer sacrifices each day and follow a prescribed
order of worship and praise and thanksgiving. These ceremonies,
Tullia declared, were carried out in great dignity and with
reverence. Nothing she had ever seen in Rome, the maid was certain,
would excel them in pageantry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you move from the Palace
of the Herods for a day or two to the Procurator&rsquo;s apartment in
the Tower of Antonia? From there you could look down on the
ceremonial rites being performed at the Temple, and no one would
need know that you were watching. And though it would have no
interest to you as a service of worship, it should prove entertaining
in the same way that the theater in Rome is diverting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be amusing at that,&rdquo; Claudia had agreed. &ldquo;And
there&rsquo;s nothing else to do in Jerusalem anyway. But how is it,
Tullia,&rdquo; she asked, and her expression clearly revealed her puzzlement,
&ldquo;that you know so much about these festival customs? Even
if your forebears were Jewish, you were brought up in Rome, and
surely you couldn&rsquo;t have learned all this at the synagogue on
Janiculum Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mistress, through the years I have read our sacred scriptures,
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
and I have heard much talk of our laws and customs. And
you must know that an Israelite, though he may never set foot in
Israel, if he is a true child of the faith, is loyal to our one God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know little about Israelites or their Yahweh, and I care less
about either&rdquo;&mdash;she smiled&mdash;&ldquo;except for you, and I have never considered
you a Jew except perhaps by blood. But as for loyalty, by
all the gods, little one, I know you are loyal to me, just as your
mother was to mine. All this Yahweh and Temple business,
though, confuses rather than interests me. To me it seems the
sheerest nonsense. How could any being worthy of being called a
god appreciate the sight of poor cattles&rsquo; throats being slit; how
could he enjoy the smell of warm blood and broiling fat? Certainly
it nauseates me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have wondered that myself, Mistress,&rdquo; Tullia answered. &ldquo;But
I believe He is pleased because we are seeking to please Him, even
though our form of worship may not be too pleasing. Do you
understand me, Mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I believe still that your worship is nothing more than
superstition, just as our worship of the innumerable Roman and
Greek gods is superstition. But&rdquo;&mdash;she reached over and gently
pinched the slave girl&rsquo;s cheek&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do as you suggest; I&rsquo;ll venture
to watch the ceremonial at the Temple, and you can tell me what
they are doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they had gone up to Antonia and from the balcony had
watched the busy movement of the priests and the assembled
throngs, many of them pilgrims returned from every province in
the Empire, as these earnest Israelites performed the traditional
rites of the ancient festival of worship. On her first morning,
Claudia had arisen early and had stepped out onto the balcony.
The sun was just lifting above the Mount of Olives, but already
the Temple was astir, and pilgrims in their many colored robes
were swarming into the Court of the Gentiles, the nearer Court
of the Women, and the other more sacred precincts permitted to
them. In their hands they carried leafed branches.</p>
<p>Claudia stared in rapt fascination at the spectacle below. As she
leaned out over the balcony, she scarcely heard Tullia&rsquo;s footsteps
approaching behind her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Claudia replied, turning to greet the girl. She
pointed downward. &ldquo;You were right about this offering much in
the way of entertainment. It&rsquo;s nearly as good as our Roman
games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tullia laughed. &ldquo;Who knows, perhaps you, too, Mistress, may
become a convert to our ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly.&rdquo; Claudia shook her head with a wry smile. Then she
turned and looked thoughtfully down again at the bustling crowds
in the Temple courts. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing in particular, you know,
that I can&rsquo;t understand about the Jewish religion, little one.&rdquo; The
half-smile had been replaced by a perplexed frown. &ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m
mistaken, the Jews contend that their Yahweh is all-powerful,
that he&rsquo;s the only god there is, and that he rules over all peoples;
yet they call him the God of Israel and seem to believe that he
has no interest in anyone else. Down there, for example&rdquo;&mdash;she
pointed toward the Temple&mdash;&ldquo;there are signs warning foreigners
not to enter, under pain of death, certain of the sacred places.
How do the Jews explain that? It seems to me that they make
their Yahweh a sort of tribal god, one having less authority even
than our Jupiter. If Yahweh is the god of all the world, how can
the Jews claim him as exclusively theirs? And on the other hand,
if he is the god and father of all peoples, doesn&rsquo;t that make all
peoples brothers?&rdquo; She shrugged. &ldquo;I see little sense to ... all
this.&rdquo; She broke off with a quick sweep of her hand toward the
procession of priests and pilgrims moving down the slope toward
the waters of Siloam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do say that such is the teaching of Jesus, that our Yahweh
is the father of all peoples, even the pagans who have never heard
of Him, that....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Galilean. The carpenter, Mistress, of whom the Prophet
John declared himself to be the forerunner, you know. He&rsquo;s been
teaching down there at the Temple; he came up from Galilee,
though he wasn&rsquo;t here at the beginning of the feast, it was said.
The priests are bitter toward him, especially Annas and Caiaphas
and the Temple leaders; they say he is corrupting our religion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hah! Annas and Caiaphas talk of corruption! I should think
they wouldn&rsquo;t have the nerve. But have you seen this Galilean,
little one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mistress, but I should like to. They say he speaks with
great charm and clarity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the gods, I would like to hear him myself. He&rsquo;s the one,
isn&rsquo;t he, who Cornelius contends healed his little servant boy?
Maybe we could prevail on him to do some other feats of magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his followers, so I hear, deny that he works magic. They
say he does such things of his own power and authority, as the
Messiah of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Cornelius believes, according to Longinus; he thinks the
Galilean is a man-god and that he really healed the little boy, but
Longinus wasn&rsquo;t that na&iuml;ve. I wish Longinus were here to see
the carpenter and hear his discoursing; I&rsquo;d like to know <i>his</i> opinion
of the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Longinus was not in Jerusalem. Cornelius had failed in his
promise to bring the centurion to the Feast of Tabernacles. Hardly
a week before they were to leave Tiberias, Cornelius had received
a message from Longinus saying that the Prefect Sejanus had sent
him instructions to board ship at Tyre for Antioch, where he
would have business with the Legate Vitellius. What the nature
of the business was, Cornelius told Claudia, had not been revealed.
Nor had Longinus indicated how long he would be away. Had she
known he would not be in the Judaean capital, Claudia told her
maid, she herself would have remained in the provincial capital
on the coast. That would have given her two weeks of freedom
from Pontius Pilate, at any rate, for Pilate, with a maniple of
soldiers and a retinue of servants, had come up with her to the
festival and would probably remain in Jerusalem until the final
ceremonies were completed and all the withered booths had been
removed.</p>
<p>In late afternoon the Procurator&rsquo;s wife ate an early dinner, and
as the sun dropped behind the western walls, she stood again with
Tullia at the balcony&rsquo;s parapet and looked down upon the animated
movement within the Temple&rsquo;s courts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Mistress!&rdquo; Tullia pointed. &ldquo;They all carry unlighted
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
torches. It will be beautiful, the illumination of the Temple. This
is the great event of the festival; it is called the &lsquo;Joy of the Feast.&rsquo;
When the sun goes down, a watchman on the western wall of
the Temple will give the signal and the candelabra will be lighted.
See how high they are, perhaps thirty cubits. The light from them
will illuminate the whole Temple area. It will be like nothing you
have seen, Mistress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bona Dea, I agree it will be different. And in Jerusalem,
Tullia, you&rsquo;re different. I do believe I&rsquo;ve never before seen you
so excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The service began with a great company of priests and Levites
alternating in the antiphonal chant of the Psalms and other sacred
Hebrew scriptures. Then, as the shadows lengthened and the quick
murk of descending night began to envelop the vast edifice and
the thousands massed within it, one of the priests, bearing a long
lighted taper, moved through the Court of the Priests and down
the steps to the Court of the Women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Mistress! See the priest carrying the lighted taper,&rdquo;
Tullia said, her enthusiasm mounting. &ldquo;With it he will light the
great candelabra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The advancing priest paused. &ldquo;Arise, shine!&rdquo; his voice suddenly
rang out, &ldquo;for thy Light is come! And the glory of the Lord is
risen upon thee!&rdquo; Deliberately, with all eyes upon him, he lighted
first the central candle in the great stand, and then as quickly as
he could with the uplifted long taper he touched the flickering
flame to each of the three on either side of the central one; when
he had finished his task before the first great candelabrum, he
crossed with measured tread to the other and lighted it. As he
touched the last candle and the flame caught, a great welling up
of excited, triumphant song was lifted to the two on the balcony
above, one the pagan daughter of Roman emperors and the other,
her slave maid, daughter of ancient and buffeted Israel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the song mean, Tullia?&rdquo; Claudia asked. &ldquo;It seems
to have a tone of triumph, of victory. Yet how can the people of
Israel boast of their victories, if that is what they are doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a song of triumph, Mistress,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It speaks, like
the Feast of Tabernacles itself does, of the days when our fathers
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
were led by the God of Israel out of bondage in Egypt. The song
recalls, like the flaming candelabra, the long and wearisome journey
upward into the promised land when the pillar of cloud led by
day and the pillar of fire by night. It is more of the lore of our
people. But look! The procession of light is beginning! See the
torches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>First came the Levites. In procession they passed the flaming
candelabra, and as each man came opposite the blazing, darting
fire, he mounted the steps, lifted high his torch, and touched it to
the flame. Soon the torches of the Levites, followed by those of the
pilgrims, had transformed the entire mountain of the Temple into
a blaze of fire.</p>
<p>For a long moment, silent, Claudia stood at the balcony&rsquo;s parapet
and studied the procession of torchbearers; their voices, raised
in song, filled the night. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always thought that the Jewish religion had no joy in it; I thought
it was the worship of a stern, vengeful, morose god who was quick
to punish any violator of his strict and senseless laws, who demanded
bloody sacrifices and fasting and permitted no indulgence
in pleasures. But these Jews seem to be having a grand time, almost
as though they were devotees of Isis or Moloch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but without the orgies of Isis and Moloch,&rdquo; Tullia explained.
&ldquo;Many persons who are not of our faith do have that
opinion of the God of Israel. But we believe that although He is
stern and demands that we uphold His laws, He is also a loving
God who wants His people to be happy. Some will be dancing
here as long as their torches burn, Mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you may stay out and watch them as long as you like,
Tullia, but I&rsquo;m going to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more thing, Mistress,&rdquo; the slave girl asked. &ldquo;If I may, I
should like at sunrise tomorrow to slip down into the Temple
courts for the early service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, little one,&rdquo; Claudia smiled. &ldquo;But be careful. And
perhaps it would be best if you made no mention of being in the
Procurator&rsquo;s household.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c36">36</h2>
<p>Faintly at first and from afar off the silvery notes of a trumpet
floated into her bedchamber. As she seemed to rise slowly upward
out of a deep cavern of slumber, she sensed a stirring beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning watch at Castra Praetoria,&rdquo; he said, as in the dim
light of breaking day he raised himself on an elbow to look into
her face, &ldquo;and I have early duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Longinus,&rdquo; she began a murmured protest, &ldquo;must you forever
be leaving...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today is very important,&rdquo; he went on, unheeding. &ldquo;I must
meet the Prefect there to begin our journey down to Capri for an
audience with the Emperor. Sejanus is going to recommend that
Tiberius recall Pontius Pilate and banish him to Gaul and then
name me as Procurator. But you are not to go with him into banishment.
Instead, you will marry me and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the gods! Longinus! Oh, by the Bountiful Mother! So
long have we waited....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat up from her pillow. The light was seeping through the
narrow window beyond the foot of the bed; the chamber was
bursting now with the sound of trumpets. Sleepily, though she
was fast coming awake, she felt for the centurion and sought to
hold on to the dream, but she knew he was not there. And in a
moment&rsquo;s hush between the trumpetings she heard from the room
adjoining hers, through the doorway connecting the chambers, the
sonorous, heavy snoring of Pontius Pilate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tullia!&rdquo; she called, keeping her voice down. But the door to
the maid&rsquo;s smaller chamber on the side opposite the Procurator&rsquo;s
was open; she had hardly expected Tullia to be there. The trumpets
below were calling Israel to the sunrise worship, and somewhere
in the milling throng of Jerusalem dwellers and pilgrims
was her devoted maid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>She pushed down the covering, swung her feet around to the
floor, and stood up. Drawing her robe about her, she stepped into
her sandals and tiptoed out onto the balcony. Down below in
the Temple courts a few torches sputtered sporadically in the
strengthening light, and several still burning in the two giant
candelabra offered more twisting blue-black smoke than illumination.</p>
<p>But there was a glory in the east; behind the rounded crest of
the Mount of Olives a giant hand spread fingers of orange and
gold and salmon and pink, and as the aureole fanned out higher
and wider and its vivid colors swam together in one blazing
brightness, the sun ventured to peek above the hilltop. In that
instant the golden dome of the Temple flamed, and the topmost
stones around the city&rsquo;s western wall caught fire.</p>
<p>A blast of trumpets, silvery, melodious, triumphant, saluted the
sun&rsquo;s rising. And then another, and another. Looking down into
the Court of the Priests, from which the sound had come, Claudia
saw two lavishly caparisoned priests, carrying trumpets and walking
abreast, marching toward the lower Court of the Women.
They were going down the steps between the two courts when
suddenly they paused and, lifting their instruments to their lips,
once again blew three blasts. Then they moved austerely down
the remaining steps and into the court, where they paused and
blew three blasts again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can they be sun worshipers, by all the gods?&rdquo; Claudia murmured
as she watched the priests offering what appeared to be
homage to the newly risen monarch of the heavens.</p>
<p>The two priests, pacing steadily eastward through the great
Court of the Women, stopped near its center and once more blew
sharp blasts and then, lowering their trumpets, marched straight
toward the Beautiful Gate, the eastern entrance to the court. But
before the huge portal they stopped and faced about, so that now
their backs were toward the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our fathers, who worshiped likewise in this place, turned their
backs upon the sanctuary of the Lord and their faces to the sun,&rdquo;
they said in chorus, and the words came up distinctly to Claudia,
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
who was able to understand their meaning though she could not
comprehend their significance. &ldquo;But our eyes are turned toward
the Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then at least they do not worship the sun,&rdquo; she said to herself,
&ldquo;although I look upon the sun as being more godlike than their
puny spirit one god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood another moment watching the pageantry below; then
her eyes swept beyond the Temple walls to survey the tabernacled
city and the area outside its protective walls. Today, she remembered,
would see the ending of the Jewish autumn festival, the
Israelites&rsquo; traditional Feast of Tabernacles. And it was well that it
should. Already the little green bough shelters were beginning to
wilt in the October sun. The pageantry, too, must be losing its
luster, even to the people of Israel.</p>
<p><i>... And Longinus could not come to Jerusalem....</i></p>
<p>Turning from the parapet, she crossed the balcony and entered
her chamber. Taking off her robe, she slipped back into the inviting
warmth of the bed.</p>
<h2 id="c37">37</h2>
<p>The opening of the bedchamber door awakened Claudia; she sat
up in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mistress,&rdquo; Tullia said apologetically as she closed the
door behind her. &ldquo;I thought perhaps you had gone out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ve slept enough. Those early trumpets awoke
me, and I went out on the balcony and watched the services beginning.
That was probably just a short while after you left. Then
I came back to bed. But why have you returned so soon? Surely
that water-pouring ceremony isn&rsquo;t finished yet.&rdquo; She paused and
studied the slave maid. &ldquo;By the gods, Tullia, something&rsquo;s happened.
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
I can see stars in your eyes. And you&rsquo;re all out of breath;
you&rsquo;ve been running. Quickly, tell me, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mistress,&rdquo; Tullia burst out happily, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s down there! He&rsquo;s
down there right now, in the Court of the Gentiles. I ran back
to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longinus!&rdquo; Claudia scrambled to her feet.</p>
<p>The stars dimmed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mistress, I hadn&rsquo;t meant to disappoint
you. But yesterday you said you&rsquo;d like to see him....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Galilean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mistress, and he&rsquo;s down there right now. Do you remember
that woman who came with the Tetrarch Herod to Rome, the
beautiful one called Mary of Magdala?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the Court of the Women, Mistress, during the early
service, when I came upon her. I recognized her, and I knew she
was a follower of the Galilean. So I asked her to tell me if he had
come to the Feast. She said he had and that even then he was in
the Court of the Gentiles over near the Shushan Gate; today, she
said, he would be teaching there, no doubt as soon as the service
of the water pouring is finished. Soon the procession will return
from the Pool of Siloam; it may be that it&rsquo;s already back. If you&rsquo;d
like to eat, Mistress, and then go down to the Court of the
Gentiles....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I need not eat just this minute, Tullia. We&rsquo;ll go now.
Here,&rdquo; she said, holding out her robe, &ldquo;help me get dressed. I
really would like to see that man and hear him speak&rdquo;&mdash;she smiled&mdash;&ldquo;and
witness any feats of magic he might be prevailed upon to
perform.&rdquo; But quickly her expression sobered. &ldquo;Tullia, you&rsquo;ll have
to fix me so that no one would even dream he was looking at the
Procurator&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mistress, but a veil and simple stola will serve that purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia peeked into the adjoining bedchamber. It was empty.
&ldquo;Pilate no doubt has gone to the Praetorium,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He
needn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m going down into the Temple precincts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Tullia&rsquo;s aid, she dressed, and they descended to the
ground level and went out through the great vaulted doorway on
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
the south side of the Tower. A moment later the two women,
heavily veiled, entered the Temple enclosure through the North
Gate of Asuppim and headed toward the Soreg, a lacy latticework
of carefully carved and interwoven stones four and a half feet
high surrounding the Temple itself. From there they turned left
and strode eastward through the vast Court of the Gentiles with
its jam of worshipers and the idly curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary said that he usually sits over there&rdquo;&mdash;Tullia pointed
toward the cloisters along the eastern wall of the Temple&mdash;&ldquo;near
the Shushan Gate.&rdquo; The Shushan Gate was at the northern end
of the wall, directly east of the Beautiful Gate. Steps led up from
the Court of the Gentiles to the Chel, a corridor running between
the Soreg and the walls of the Temple proper, in which sat the
resplendent, great Shushan Gate. The Court of the Women, in
turn, was several feet higher than the Chel. At the western end
of the Court of the Women, centering the wall, was another large
opening, the Gate of Nicanor, and directly west of this gate and
on a still more uplifted platform, stood the Great Altar. A person
at the Gate of Shushan could look above marble steps ascending
from one court level to another to the priests performing their
orders before this tremendous and imposing pyramidal altar of
burnt offerings.</p>
<p>As Claudia and Tullia neared the eastern end of the Soreg they
could see the Shushan Gate, but no group was knotted about it.
They could look across the cloister and out through the gate to
the rise of the Mount of Olives beyond the Brook Kidron far
below. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not there,&rdquo; Tullia said, her tone revealing disappointment.
&ldquo;Perhaps he went with the procession to the Pool of Siloam
and has not yet returned. Surely he will be here soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as they turned the corner to their left, the two women saw
a motley throng pushed together in a half circle about the steps
that led up to the Chel. &ldquo;Maybe Jesus is there,&rdquo; Tullia exclaimed,
keeping her voice low, for now they were nearing the outer edge
of this crowd. She turned to confront a lean and bearded tall
Israelite. &ldquo;We have just come here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We wonder why
all these people are gathered about. Is some rabbi expounding the
law?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Galilean whom some hold to be the Messiah of God.
The priests and the scholars have been trying to confuse him, but
he has thrown their words back into their teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved forward into the outer fringe of the group and
eased their steps toward the man sitting before the Beautiful Gate
until soon they had an unobstructed view of him. From where
they stood they could also see through the wide portals of the
Beautiful Gate across the Court of the Women and the Gate of
Nicanor to the Great Altar, upon which the High Priest Caiaphas,
with two other Temple dignitaries assisting him, had tipped the
golden ewer of water from the Pool of Siloam as a libation to
Yahweh. Many of those now listening to the discourse of the
Galilean had been present for the ceremonies of the water pouring,
including a small knot of lavishly robed Israelites whom Tullia
immediately recognized as the men who had been attempting to
confound Jesus with their hate-inspired but politely phrased questions.</p>
<p>Evidently one of these men, a stout Pharisee from the looks of
his garb, had just so challenged the Galilean. But if Jesus was
perturbed, he did not indicate it. He was speaking calmly, and his
resonant but gentle Galilean Aramaic came clearly to them above
the din of the cattle in the stalls along the northern cloisters. &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t speak with the fire and thunder of that Wilderness
prophet,&rdquo; Claudia observed in whispered comment. &ldquo;He seems not
to be the fanatical type, and I&rsquo;m surprised. He&rsquo;s handsome, too,
and I&rsquo;m even more surprised at that. I thought he would be another
lean and burnt, arm-waving, shouting fanatic, one with a
long messy beard, flaming eyes, and soiled clothing&mdash;a generally
anemic look. But this one&rsquo;s a strong fellow, though his manner&rsquo;s
gentle enough. Even so, there&rsquo;s something odd about this. I wonder....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But suddenly she stopped speaking, for the rabbi had raised
his bronzed hand, long forefinger extended, to point to one of the
Pharisees who had been questioning him. &ldquo;You say that I am but
testifying to myself and that therefore my testimony is invalid.
But I say unto you, my brother, that my testimony is valid. Is it
not written in the law that the testimony of two witnesses establishes
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
the fact? Then my testimony is true, for I bear witness and
likewise my Father that sent me bears witness. That makes two
witnesses; that establishes the truthfulness of the testimony I have
borne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this father of whom he speaks?&rdquo; asked a man standing
near the two women. &ldquo;Is he not the son of a carpenter of Nazareth
long dead? How then does he say that his father&rsquo;s testimony corroborates
his own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not speaking of his natural father,&rdquo; another man standing
near-by replied. &ldquo;He means the God of Israel as his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t that blasphemy? How can a man call himself the son
of Israel&rsquo;s God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if indeed he is the Messiah....&rdquo; The second man paused,
his hand on the questioner&rsquo;s arm, for Jesus had arisen and, turning,
was pointing toward the high altar before the Holy of Holies.
&ldquo;Behold, I am the water of life! If any man thirst, let him come
unto me and drink.&rdquo; The Galilean spoke in calm tones but with
warmth of feeling, and in the pause that followed none of his
hearers spoke. Again he pointed, this time toward the giant candelabra
below the Gate of Nicanor in the Court of the Women;
last night the great court and all the environs of the Temple had
been ablaze with light from the candelabra and the hundreds of
flaming torches. &ldquo;I am the light of the world!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;He
that follows me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the
light of life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia nudged her maid. &ldquo;What does he mean, Tullia?&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I know, Mistress,&rdquo; the girl answered. &ldquo;But I take
it he&rsquo;s using a kind of symbolism that the Jews can understand.
He must be referring to the ceremony of water pouring and to
last night&rsquo;s illumination of the Temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the carping Pharisees and the other Temple leaders pretended
likewise not to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water of life, the light of the world. And your father
being a witness to the truthfulness of the testimony you present.
These things are incomprehensible to us,&rdquo; one of them declared.
&ldquo;Rabbi, wasn&rsquo;t your father a carpenter in Galilee? And where is he
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
to support your witness? Isn&rsquo;t he dead? How then can you say
that you and your father make two witnesses? We have not seen
your father, nor have we heard him speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak the truth when you say that you have not seen my
Father.&rdquo; His voice was calm, even gentle, but his eyes were filled
with fire. &ldquo;Neither have you seen me. For if you had seen me, you
would likewise have seen my Father, for the Father is in me and
I am in the Father. My Father and I are one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he speaking of the God of Israel as his father?&rdquo; A portly
Pharisee near the two women had turned to speak with one of his
colleagues. &ldquo;Is that the meaning of his strange utterance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blasphemy!&rdquo; declared the questioner. &ldquo;He makes himself one
with God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jesus had heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he declared, looking the fat one full in the face. &ldquo;Only
truth. And if you knew me and were willing to live by my teaching,
you would know the truth, and the truth would make you
free. You would not walk in darkness, but in the light of the world,
in the fullness of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rabbi, we are free. We are children of Abraham. We are
not slaves. How can you say that we would be made free? We have
never been slaves to any man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any man who sins is a slave, and no slave is a son of the house;
yet if the son of the house sets him free, he is no longer a slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we <i>are</i> sons of Abraham. We are no bastards. We are the
children of the God of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus leveled his forefinger at the protesting Pharisee. &ldquo;No, you
are not the sons of the Father; you are rather sons of the Evil One,
for he is the enemy of truth and you likewise are its enemies.&rdquo; His
words were uttered in calmness, but they were emphatic, and his
eyes flashed. &ldquo;You will neither hear the truth nor comprehend it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rabbi, you must be mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus smiled, and Claudia, who had been watching him in complete
fascination since her first sight of him, thought she detected a
hint of restrained amusement in his dark eyes. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
am not mad; I speak the truth, and whoever lives by the truth, my
brother, will not even see death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t all the fathers in ages before&mdash;Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob, Isaiah, all the righteous ones of old&mdash;haven&rsquo;t they all met
death? Then how can you say that others will not die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say, he is not speaking of physical death,&rdquo; Tullia whispered.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious he&rsquo;s referring to the afterlife of the spirit.
But these sniveling Pharisees don&rsquo;t even want to understand him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet Jesus did not answer the Temple leader, for in the rear of
the press about him a commotion had arisen and the Galilean had
turned from the questioning Pharisee to look out over the heads
of the people now craning their necks to see the cause of the
tumult. The questioner and his little knot had turned, too; the
Galilean&rsquo;s inquisitor, Tullia surmised, was quite willing for the exchange
to be ended, for he had not been faring well in matching
wits and words with the tall one from Nazareth.</p>
<p>Tullia and Claudia, too, had twisted about to look eastward
toward the sounds that so precipitately had disturbed the strangely
inspiriting discourse and the carping questions of the Nazarene&rsquo;s
challengers. In that same instant they saw, out in front of the
gate of Shushan, several coarse men half-dragging, half-carrying a
bedraggled Jewish woman toward the throng ringed about Jesus.
As the crowd opened a lane inward to the Galilean, the men
rushed the poor creature toward him and savagely thrust her to
the ground at his feet. A man who had been walking in the rear
of the pitiful procession, whom Tullia took to be a minor Temple
priest, stepped in front of Jesus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rabbi, this woman has been taken in the act of adultery, in
the very act, Rabbi, as the witnesses will testify. Now the law of
Moses says that such a woman must be stoned.&rdquo; He paused, and
his eyes surveyed the half circle of intent, set faces. Along the
rim heads nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that really the law of the Israelites?&rdquo; Claudia whispered.
&ldquo;Stone to death a woman for such offense, by all the gods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s the old Mosaic law, Mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is barbarous, Tullia. By all the gods, if I were a Jew,
then they....&rdquo; But she paused, for the man had turned back
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
to question the Galilean. &ldquo;You, however, Rabbi, have been teaching
a new law. What would you say to her punishment? Must
she be stoned in accordance with our ancient laws or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus was eying the poor woman, who had scrambled to her
feet and was trying to smooth out her disordered robe. Frightened
and humiliated, she kept her eyes on the ground; then, as the
man finished his question and the suddenly quiet throng listened
for the reply, she raised them and looked, with a mixture of defiance,
contempt, and fright, at the tall bronzed man before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can he say?&rdquo; Claudia whispered. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they trying
to trap him into advocating violation of their laws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mistress. And they know, too, that they have no authority
to stone anyone to death unless the person is first condemned by
the Procurator. Either way, it&rsquo;s a trap they&rsquo;re trying to set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall speak to Pilate....&rdquo; She stopped; Tullia had laid
a gently restraining hand on her arm, for Jesus had bent down suddenly
and without offering to answer the Jew who had questioned
him had begun to trace with extended forefinger certain
markings in the dust of the marble pavement.</p>
<p>About him stood the silent crowd. Some seemed fearful of the
horror they might soon be witnessing; others, their cold smiles
attesting to their sadistic natures, were waiting expectantly to witness
the woman&rsquo;s death agonies; only a few solemn faces revealed
concern and deep pity. But the little knot of Pharisees stood with
arms folded across their rounded paunches; their smug smiles betrayed
their confidence that at last, on the final day of the great
festival, they had run to earth this annoying and dangerous young
Galilean who had been so cleverly eluding them.</p>
<p>Then, raising his head, Jesus faced the man who had questioned
him. &ldquo;You have testified aright as to the law of our father Moses,&rdquo;
he said, his voice calm, deliberate. &ldquo;The law of Moses commands
that the woman ... and the man ... taken in adultery be
stoned. But you ask me my interpretation of this law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do, Rabbi. What will you do with this woman?&rdquo; The man
looked about the semicircle of cold, hard faces, and one by one
the Pharisees nodded approval of his questioning. &ldquo;Rabbi, what
is your law in this case?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>&ldquo;I answer you, my brother, in this wise, and this is my interpretation
of the law. Let him that is without sin among you cast the
first stone.&rdquo; His quiet, dark eyes rested a moment on the startled
countenance of the man who had just propounded the question,
and then quickly they moved along the line of the challenging
Temple leaders.</p>
<p>Now once more he bent forward and with stiffened forefinger
traced symbols in the dust.</p>
<p>For a long moment his eyes remained fixed upon the pavement.
When he looked up, the little group of sneering Pharisees had
departed. The others in the ring about him had fallen back from
the steps on which he sat and stood regarding him with frank
amazement; some of them revealed their delight at his having
confounded his enemies, and on the faces of others could be seen
a heightened responsiveness to the young man&rsquo;s teachings and
for the Galilean himself a strengthened affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman, where are your accusers?&rdquo; he asked the amazed poor
creature, from whom in the swift moment of his answer had fled
all trace of defiant insolence. &ldquo;Does no man remain to condemn
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted her tear-streaked face to him. &ldquo;No man, Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I condemn you. Go now, and sin no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia could not understand the woman&rsquo;s murmured reply,
but on her face clearly discernible was a look of radiance as she
bowed to the Galilean and, turning, slipped away out of the
crowd. At the same time the Procurator&rsquo;s wife noticed a large,
bushy-bearded fellow, wide of shoulders and heavily muscled, pushing
through the throng from the direction of the Gate Shalleketh.
He walked up to Jesus, who had stood up as the woman was leaving.
&ldquo;Master, you have been here a long while; you must be weary.
Let us go over to Bethany to rest a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fisherman I saw one day at Tiberias,&rdquo; whispered
Tullia. &ldquo;He is of the Galilean&rsquo;s company; his name, I think, is
Simon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd now began to disperse, for Jesus and the big fisherman
were moving off toward the Gate Shushan. They came past
the two women, so close to them that Claudia could have reached
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
out and touched the tall Galilean. Their eyes met; he smiled and
passed on. She stood rooted, watching the two until they had
passed out of sight down the slope toward the Brook Kidron.
&ldquo;He seemed to recognize me,&rdquo; she said to herself, as suddenly
a fanciful thought crossed her mind. &ldquo;But of course he didn&rsquo;t;
he&rsquo;s never in all his life seen me before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the two men&rsquo;s disappearance, however, the spell was
broken. Claudia caught her maid&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be going
now,&rdquo; she said. But she was still lost in her own thoughts; they
had rounded the corner of the Soreg and were nearing the North
Gate of Asuppim before she spoke again. &ldquo;By the gods, what a
man! What a marvelous, strange Jew. And he didn&rsquo;t do any feats
of magic either. Little one, I&rsquo;m so glad you brought me down
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress, now that you&rsquo;ve seen him and heard his discourse,
even though for but a few minutes, what is your opinion of him?
Do you think that perhaps he really is the Messiah of Israel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of the Messiah of Israel ... and care nothing.
And this idea of a man&rsquo;s being a god, even though we Romans
are supposed to believe that the gods come to earth in the form of
men, is just as incomprehensible to me as it is to Longinus. Maybe
that&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t believe in the gods in the first place.&rdquo; They
were going through the great North Gate of Asuppim when
Claudia stopped and caught Tullia&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Nevertheless, little
one&mdash;and you asked me my opinion of him&mdash;there is something
tremendously different about that man. I&rsquo;m sure I have never encountered
another like him. He&rsquo;s a quick thinker and able to out-wit
his enemies, and he&rsquo;s evidently a good and just man. But there&rsquo;s
something else&rdquo;&mdash;she paused, her forehead creased in a frown&mdash;&ldquo;something
to me, at any rate, mystifying. The way he looked at
me, Tullia....&rdquo; Her solemn expression relaxed into a quick,
warming smile. &ldquo;Perhaps he <i>is</i> your Messiah of the Jews, little one,
whatever that means!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<h2 id="c38">38</h2>
<p>On her return to Caesarea from the Feast of Tabernacles, Claudia
learned from Sergius Paulus that Longinus had sailed for Rome.
The message from the centurion to the commander of the Roman
constabulary had been brought by a ship&rsquo;s master who had sailed
southward from the Antioch port of Seleucia shortly after Longinus
had gone aboard a ship there for his voyage to the capital.</p>
<p>The message had been brief, the commander said; its purpose
was to let him know that Longinus had been sent to Rome by the
Legate Vitellius on what the legate must have considered an
urgent mission, probably to the Prefect Sejanus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longinus must have sailed from Seleucia on one of the last
boats out,&rdquo; Sergius observed. &ldquo;From now until spring there&rsquo;ll be
few crossings; any ship attempting to make it will be braving the
heavy winds.&rdquo; He smiled wryly. &ldquo;It must have been important
business the legate was sending him on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia suspected that Longinus was going to the capital to relay
the legate&rsquo;s report on the situation in Palestine. Particularly
important, she knew, would be the question of whether or not
King Aretas was planning to attack Herod and thereby involve
the whole Palestinian region in war. But she had no direct message
from the centurion.</p>
<p>Longinus was acting wisely, she realized, in sending her no written
communication. He could hardly evolve any innocent appearing
reason for writing her, and it would be impossible to send
her such a message without Pilate&rsquo;s learning about it, and possibly
even the Prefect. And any message sent would of necessity be
innocuous. But as the weeks pushed deeper and deeper into winter
and no word of him came to her at all, she began to wonder if
he would return to Palestine or if, the gods forbid, Sejanus might
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
have sent him once more to Germania or Gaul or to some other
post far remote from the now increasingly dreary Palestine.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that it was Herodias who had urged her to
go up to Jerusalem for the Feast of Tabernacles, the two women
had hardly seen one another during those days in Israel&rsquo;s capital.
Claudia recalled that even then the Tetrarchess had seemed somewhat
reserved. And once when mention was made of the journey
of Longinus to Antioch in response to the summons of the Legate
Vitellius, Herodias had appeared to grow even more coldly formal.
Perhaps the Tetrarchess suspected, Claudia thought at the time,
that Longinus was reporting on Herod&rsquo;s visit to Machaerus and
the appearance there of the ambassadors from King Aretas, and
even of her own bizarre conduct at the Tetrarch&rsquo;s birthday banquet.
Nor had Herodias, as they were preparing to leave Jerusalem,
invited her to come to Tiberias.</p>
<p>And at the Feast neither she nor Pilate had seen Antipas. She
wondered if perhaps he, too, might have suspected that Longinus
was even then in Antioch reporting what he had seen and heard
at Machaerus. But her failure to be honored by the Tetrarch in
Jerusalem troubled her not at all. She had less respect for him,
she confessed to herself, than she had for the Procurator. And she
hoped that Longinus was finding opportunity for dropping some
poisoned, if discreet, words into the ears of Sejanus concerning
Pontius Pilate and his continuing difficulties with the Jews.</p>
<p>Nor was the Procurator&rsquo;s administration of affairs in Judaea, as
the winter advanced, serving to establish him in better favor with
the people he was governing. Stubborn and unimaginative, he
steadfastly refused either to learn anything or forget anything.
Scorning his subordinate officials and refusing to give consideration
to their counseling, fearful of his superiors, including the
Legate Vitellius and particularly the Prefect Sejanus, Pilate provided
no stable rule of Judaea; his administration vacillated from
fierce oppression and arbitrary action to cowardly yielding to
priestly demands. His tax gatherers, working through the despised
publicans, those native hirelings of Rome whom the Israelites
looked upon with loathing as traitors to Israel and Israel&rsquo;s Yahweh,
demanded and received exorbitant tribute in money and produce
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
of the land; this did not add to the Procurator&rsquo;s popularity among
the Jews. Both the people and the Temple leaders were growing
increasingly enraged.</p>
<p>The natural breach between the Procurator and the Tetrarch,
too, was widening as the weeks went by; an incident at the Temple
during one of the great festival occasions in which Pilate&rsquo;s soldiers
had slain a group of roistering Galileans had infuriated Herod
Antipas. And Pilate&rsquo;s effort to use Temple funds in the building of
an aqueduct to bring water into Jerusalem had evoked the bitter
animosity of the Temple leadership. On all sides, then, the Procurator,
beginning with his flaunting of the Roman ensigns in
Jerusalem shortly after his arrival in Judaea, had been strengthening
rather than weakening the natural hostility the Israelites had
for the representatives of conquering Rome.</p>
<p>All this Claudia had observed; she wondered how long this
mounting burden of tension and hate could continue to build
upon the broad shoulders of Pontius Pilate before inevitably it
should topple him from the Procuratorship. The answer, she was
confident, lay not in Judaea, but in Rome. Pilate would last only so
long as he did not too greatly displease Sejanus. And from the
moment the tribute from Judaea to Rome ... and Sejanus ...
began to shrink, she reasoned, her spouse&rsquo;s days as Procurator
would be numbered.</p>
<p><i> ... Perhaps Sejanus may have begun to suspect already that
Pilate&rsquo;s fingers have become sticky, that too large a proportion of
the revenues are failing to reach Rome; perhaps he has revealed,
or hinted, his suspicions to Longinus, and Longinus will tell me
everything when he returns.</i></p>
<p><i>... If he does return. But surely he will be back in Caesarea
when winter relents and calming weather permits the ships to resume
their sailing. Surely he will arrive in time to go with us to
Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover....</i></p>
<p>Thinking one day of the coming Feast, she recalled her earlier
visit with Tullia to the Temple. &ldquo;Do you remember that last day
of the Feast of Tabernacles?&rdquo; she asked, turning to her slave maid.
The girl nodded and smiled. &ldquo;That Galilean,&rdquo; Claudia continued,
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
&ldquo;your Messiah of the Jews, I wonder what has become of him. Do
you suppose he&rsquo;ll return to the Jewish capital for the Passover
festival?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say so, Mistress,&rdquo; Tullia answered. &ldquo;Every devout Jew
tries to go up for the Passover Feast. And certainly the Galilean is
a devout Jew. Even though the Temple priests are bent on destroying
him, I&rsquo;m sure he will wish to go there to worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does, maybe we&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to hear him again
... and perhaps this time he will perform some feat of magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mistress, those who hold him to be the Messiah insist
that he does not work magic; they declare he does his miracles of
healing by the will of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled. &ldquo;Well, however he does them&mdash;and even from you,
little one, I&rsquo;ve heard reports that he does&mdash;is no concern of mine.
But should he come up to the Temple and perform some such
feat, either by his own cleverness or with the aid of your Yahweh,
I would like to be there when he did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mistress, you saw him that day they dragged the woman
before him....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but his saving her from that mob was not magic, little one.
That was only the working of a quick intelligence and a good
heart. But they say he can make lame persons walk again and
blind persons see. And Cornelius, you remember, declared he
healed his little servant boy, though Longinus thinks it was only
a coincidence that the boy&rsquo;s fever broke just at the same time the
Galilean supposedly was curing him. Cornelius even believes that
the carpenter once actually restored to life the son of a widow; he
told me they were bearing the young man to the tomb when the
Galilean happened along and brought him back to life. Of course,
the boy may have been in a trance; certainly no sensible person
can believe that he was really dead and then came back to life
when the Galilean said some mysterious words and made some
queer motions over him.&rdquo; She paused and looked Tullia in the
eyes. &ldquo;Or do you, little one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he is actually the son of our God....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you gullible Jews, even you, Tullia.&rdquo; Her countenance revealed
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
an amused tolerance. &ldquo;And Cornelius. A soldier of Rome.
But how, by all the gods, Tullia, can any present-day person of
education and culture embrace such blatant superstition to believe
that a man could come to earth as a god, even if he could believe
that there are gods in the first place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tullia skillfully evaded answering the question. &ldquo;If you saw
him restore to life a man who you knew was dead, what would
you say about him then, Mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I see him do that, little one, I&rsquo;ll tell you then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Claudia had not dismissed the Galilean from
her thoughts, for that night she dreamed about him. It was a
confused and illogical arrangement of stories she had heard about
Jesus, interwoven with the experience she and Tullia had had that
day at the Temple during the final exercises of the Feast of Tabernacles.
In the dream she and Longinus had strolled with Cornelius
down from the Tower of Antonia into the Court of the Gentiles.
Rounding a corner of the Soreg, the three had come upon a
throng ringed about the Galilean. They had pushed forward to
the inner circle, and there, they had discovered on the stones
of the court at the carpenter&rsquo;s feet a crushed and bloody woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rabbi,&rdquo; a burly fellow beside the woman was saying, &ldquo;this
woman is dead. We caught her in the act of adultery, and in accordance
with the law of our father Moses we stoned her to death.
I ask you, Rabbi, did not we do well in thus upholding the ancient
law of Israel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the law that the woman and the man taken in adultery be
stoned to death,&rdquo; the Galilean replied, and then his eyes flamed
and his voice took on a new intensity, &ldquo;but you who stoned her,
were you without sins?&rdquo; Then he lowered his eyes to the stones
beside the dead woman and began with his forefinger to trace
symbols in the dust. After a moment he stood up and, bending
down, caught the stiffened body underneath his arms and raised
it, unbending, until it stood upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said Cornelius, &ldquo;she is dead, completely dead; see
her mangled face, her crushed skull. Watch the Galilean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus was steadying the rigid corpse with one hand. Now he
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
raised his other hand to a position above her head and began
to intone words that to Claudia were strange and utterly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch now,&rdquo; said Cornelius. &ldquo;Keep your eyes on him. And,
remember, the woman is dead; there is no life in her, none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Incredulous, their eyes straining, they saw the stiffened limbs
beginning to relax and the head bend forward slightly; the crushed
bones of the shattered face rounded outward, the torn and bruised
flesh smoothed, the clotted blood melted away, and the desecrated
ghastly countenance was restored to a calm beauty; the woman,
looking now into the serene face of the Galilean, smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the great gods ...&rdquo; But Longinus hushed precipitately,
for Jesus was speaking to the woman, now fully alert. &ldquo;No man
condemns you, my sister, and neither do I,&rdquo; Jesus said, as he
pointed toward her executioners, now slinking away toward the
Gate of Shushan. &ldquo;Go, and sin no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus turned now to the Procurator&rsquo;s wife, and on his face
she saw an expression of utter amazement. &ldquo;But, Claudia, the
woman was dead! Her head was crushed; her face was a bloody
pulp. And now, look! She is walking away, around the corner
of the Soreg! The Galilean, Claudia, he must be a god! By all the
gods, Claudia, this man must be a god! He must be....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Longinus&rsquo; voice was fading, and he was receding, slipping
away, and so were Cornelius and the Galilean and the woman....</p>
<p>Claudia opened her eyes; her chamber was flooded with light.
She closed them again, trying to recapture the scene in the great
court of the Temple. But the dream had fled. &ldquo;Bona Dea,&rdquo; she
said aloud. &ldquo;It was so real. That woman. And the Galilean. And
Cornelius and Longinus. So vivid. Maybe&rdquo;&mdash;the notion suddenly
occurred to her&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreaming now, maybe I&rsquo;m dreaming that I
was dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat up, swung her feet around to the floor, stretched and
yawned. Then quickly she arose and crossing to the window, looked
down at the ships in the harbor. Bright sunlight flashed from the
hulls and the billowing sails. On the docks slaves struggled with
casks and crates as they loaded and unloaded vessels. The world she
was seeing was real; she stood looking through her window upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
things tangible and comprehensible. The dream, with all its implications
of the inscrutable, was gone, vanished.</p>
<p>But she was not to forget it entirely. One day Tullia revealed
that while at the market place she had encountered some travelers
from Galilee who had gone up to Jerusalem and were returning
by way of Caesarea. On their journey, they told her, they had come
upon the Galilean and several of his band in a hamlet in the mountains
of Ephraim. Jesus had returned to Galilee from the Feast
of Tabernacles, but after several weeks he had gone back for the
Feast of Dedication. From Jerusalem he had retired into Peraea.</p>
<p>As Tullia related the story she had been told, her eyes began to
shine. &ldquo;While he was on the other side of the Jordan,&rdquo; she went
on, &ldquo;he received a message from Bethany....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bethany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small village a few miles&mdash;a mile or so&mdash;just west of
Jerusalem, Mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus had three friends who lived there, a man and his two sisters.
While he was over beyond the Jordan he had word that the
man was near death. So he and his band returned to Bethany.
When they got there, they found that his friend had been dead
four days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Galilean brought him back to life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mistress! That&rsquo;s what the travelers said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia laughed. &ldquo;Cornelius should have been there. No doubt,
though, he&rsquo;s already heard about it. And, of course, he believes the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t, Mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia wasn&rsquo;t sure that the servant woman was teasing. &ldquo;No,
Tullia, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Very probably this story has been
repeated many times and has been added to by each teller. No
doubt it was like the one Cornelius was telling about the widow&rsquo;s
son, or even the incident in which his own little slave boy was
supposed to have been cured by the Galilean. Obviously, the man
at Bethany was not dead; no doubt they thought he was....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mistress, they said he had been in the tomb four days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;They said it, yes. Perhaps he hadn&rsquo;t been entombed that long;
but if he had, what of it? He wouldn&rsquo;t have suffocated; tombs
aren&rsquo;t sealed that securely. In all probability the man was in a
trance when they put him away; no doubt the carpenter roused
him from the trance into which he had fallen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress, you have little faith in the Galilean.&rdquo; Tullia&rsquo;s dark
eyes were serious now. &ldquo;You cannot see how he could be the
Messiah of the Jews and armed with unearthly power, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that any man can restore life to another man,
if that&rsquo;s what you mean, little one. I cannot believe that any
human possesses supernatural power; in fact, as I have told you
many times, I doubt the existence of supernatural beings, including
your Yahweh.&rdquo; She laughed again. &ldquo;But you and Cornelius
outnumber me. I should have Longinus here to support me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when a few weeks later the Centurion Longinus did sail
into the harbor at Caesarea, Claudia had no longer a thought for
the Galilean mystic and his reported wonder-working.</p>
<p>The centurion journeyed on a coastal vessel bound from Seleucia
to Alexandria. He had sailed from Rome as soon as weather conditions
permitted; from Seleucia he had moved on to Antioch to
report to the Legate Vitellius. Returning a few days later, he had
boarded another vessel destined for the Palestinian ports and Alexandria.</p>
<p>On coming ashore at Caesarea the centurion went first to the
garrison headquarters and reported to Sergius Paulus. That duty
completed, he visited the Procurator&rsquo;s Palace, ostensibly to pay his
respects to Pontius Pilate. The Procurator, polite but coldly formal,
talked with him for only a moment before excusing himself
and leaving the palace. Longinus, remarking about it to Claudia,
wondered if the Procurator was finally becoming jealous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t jealous, by all the gods, and that makes me furious
with him!&rdquo; Claudia had answered. &ldquo;But he may suspect that you&rsquo;ve
been spying on him and that Vitellius called you to Antioch to
report on his administration of affairs in Judaea and then sent you
to Rome to relay information and suggestions to Sejanus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would be entirely right, too, in thinking so. And you can
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
add old Herod Antipas to my watched list.&rdquo; He thought, with
sudden amusement, of the third name on the list given him by
Sejanus when first the Prefect sent him out to Palestine, but he
did not comment. &ldquo;And what I told the Prefect about both of
them, for the Legate Vitellius and from my own observations,
didn&rsquo;t make them any more secure in their positions, by the gods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly he related his experiences in Rome; he had met several
times with Sejanus, once to discuss ways of increasing the output
of the glassworks in Phoenicia. On another occasion the two had
gone out to Capri for an audience with Tiberius. &ldquo;The Emperor
asked about his beloved stepdaughter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I professed
to have little information about you. Sejanus also quizzed me&mdash;I&rsquo;m
sure he still suspects us&mdash;but he, too, learned nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is going to happen, Longinus&mdash;about us, I mean&mdash;and
when? Is there any likelihood still of Pilate&rsquo;s being recalled
... soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d say there was. I know Sejanus is losing patience with
Pilate; he seems to hear everything that happens out here, and
Pilate&rsquo;s inability to rule Judaea without continually provoking
turmoil and protesting by the Jews angers the Prefect. The only
thing that&rsquo;s kept Pilate as Procurator this long, I suspect, is the
fact that Sejanus apparently doesn&rsquo;t suspect that Pilate is dipping
too heavily into the taxes, if he is ... and I can&rsquo;t say yet that he
is. That was one question he kept coming back to in talking with
me, if there was any evidence that the Procurator was not sending
to Rome all the revenues he was supposed to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the Prefect indicate that he might call Pilate to Rome
for questioning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say that he did. But if the Procurator should be
ordered to the capital to justify his administration of Judaea, he
won&rsquo;t be returned, you can be sure. The same thing is true of
Herod Antipas. I believe the Procurator and the Tetrarch stand
in precarious positions; the next few months could determine
the fate of both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus left the palace soon after Pilate had departed; he and
Claudia, they agreed, would meet again when the opportunity was
afforded. But that opportunity did not come quickly; he did not
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
return to the palace until the Procurator summoned him there to
discuss plans for the forthcoming journey to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>A week later the Procurator and his party, with Longinus commanding
one of the escorting centuries, set out for Israel&rsquo;s capital
and the great Feast of the Passover.</p>
<h2 title=""><span class="sc">Jerusalem</span></h2>
<div class="img">

<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<h2 id="c39">39</h2>
<p>The caravan from Galilee had halted on the plain before Jericho
for rest and the midday meal, and now the Tetrarch&rsquo;s party and
the escorting soldiers of Cornelius&rsquo; century were preparing to resume
their journey. Two days and a half of steady traveling southward
had brought them from Tiberias through the rapidly greening
gorge of the Jordan, and soon they would face the most grueling
and dangerous part of the journey, the steep and boulder-locked
climb to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Centurion Cornelius, who had been making a quick inspection
of the assembled legionaries, approached Herod Antipas and
saluted. &ldquo;Sire, I need now to determine your wishes&rdquo;&mdash;he bowed
to Herodias&mdash;&ldquo;and the wishes of the Tetrarchess, for the remainder
of our journey up to Jerusalem. If you wish to rest awhile, we
could make camp here and leave early in the morning for Jerusalem.
Or we could move on now and camp for the night where the
Jericho road begins its ascent to Jerusalem. But if you prefer, we
can set out now and not stop until we reach the capital, though
it will probably be well past nightfall before we enter the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you fearful of traveling the Jericho road after the sun has
set, Centurion?&rdquo; Antipas inquired. &ldquo;Do you think that perhaps
robbers or zealot bands might sweep down on us from the rocks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no fear, Sire; certainly none, if they knew our strength,
would attempt it. And before we enter that region, I&rsquo;ll rearrange
our order of march to strengthen our guard against a surprise attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suggest that we continue on to Jerusalem today,&rdquo;
Herodias spoke up. &ldquo;We can rest better tomorrow in the palace
than we can here in camp, even though&rdquo;&mdash;she turned malevolent
eyes on the Tetrarch, and her tone was bitterly sarcastic&mdash;&ldquo;we shall
be lodging in the old Hasmonean Palace in order that our Palace
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
of the Herods may be occupied by the Procurator and his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Tetrarchess is right, Centurion,&rdquo; Antipas agreed complaisantly.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s push on to Jerusalem today.&rdquo; He ignored his
wife&rsquo;s caustic remark. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have tonight and all tomorrow to rest
before the start of the Passover celebration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beyond Jericho, where the Peraean road joined the road up from
Galilee and one that came down along the western side of the
Jordan from the region of Ephraim, the way began to fill with pilgrims
going up to Israel&rsquo;s capital for the annual great spring festival
of the Passover. As the caravan neared the point where the
road began its steep climb, Cornelius called a halt. While the
Tetrarch and Herodias were having a brief respite from their
saddles, he called in his legionaries and changed the pattern of
their advance. Down through the Jordan valley they had been
moving in column along the roadway with guards ahead of and
behind the Tetrarch&rsquo;s party and only now and then a few soldiers
on the flanks.</p>
<p>But now Cornelius gave orders to Decius to divide the century
into three groups, the largest of which would continue along the
Jericho road, while the other two would move forward with the
Tetrarch&rsquo;s group, one on its right flank, the other on the left, and
each several hundred yards from the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not expecting any trouble,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;but if there
are any Zealots lying in wait for us, in all probability they&rsquo;ll be up
there in that defile where the road cuts through the rocks. You
men out on the flanks will be able to beat them off; if they&rsquo;re
crouched beside the road, we&rsquo;ll trap them between your columns
and us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the division of the century had been completed, the centurion
had a final warning. &ldquo;Stay abreast of us, and keep in contact.
And now, let&rsquo;s get moving. Men, keep your eyes open. These
Zealots are bent on killing every Roman in Palestine. They&rsquo;re
clever, and they know every foot of ground in this region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steep rise of the narrow Jericho road and the push of pilgrims
trudging ahead slowed the progress of the caravan, and it was
nearing sunset when once more Cornelius halted the column. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
been a hard climb, and the animals are laboring,&rdquo; he explained to
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
the Tetrarch. &ldquo;A short rest will refresh us for the last few miles
into Jerusalem. Soon we&rsquo;ll be past the boulders and can move
faster. And with danger of assault by robbers ended, we can pull
in our flanking files. So we should be approaching Jerusalem by
nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the centurion had spoken too quickly. They went hardly a
mile farther and were moving slowly through the last narrow defile
in the ascending road before it veered sharply around screening
boulders to come on a level plateau extending to the vicinity
of Bethany; the caravan was strung out in a long column and the
advance guard had disappeared around the turn in the gorge-like
roadway. In the instant that Herod and the Tetrarchess, with
Cornelius and several of the escorting legionaries just ahead of or
behind them, had advanced into the narrowest portion of the rock-walled
canyon, they heard a sudden commotion above them. Looking
up, they saw on each side of the pass, glaring down upon them
and with spears poised, a group of grizzled, fierce-eyed insurgents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt, Roman dogs!&rdquo; shouted a hulking, reddish-bearded fellow,
as he drew back his spear menacingly. &ldquo;Get down from your
beast before I nail you to his belly like a thief to his cross! And
you&rdquo;&mdash;with his free hand he gestured toward the Tetrarch&mdash;&ldquo;you
traitor to Israel, you fawning puppet of evil Rome, stay where you
are! You, too&rdquo;&mdash;his angry black eyes were studying Herodias&mdash;&ldquo;you
adulterous sharer of your uncle&rsquo;s bed, don&rsquo;t you move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? What do you want?&rdquo; Cornelius demanded
loudly, in the hope that his soldiers in the flanking columns would
hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be screaming, soldier,&rdquo; the burly fellow said
calmly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody to help you. We have you surrounded.
See?&rdquo; He pointed to his men in the rocks on the other side of the
road. &ldquo;One wrong move and we&rsquo;ll stick your carcasses full of spears.
And you needn&rsquo;t be hoping for help from those up ahead&rdquo;&mdash;he
motioned&mdash;&ldquo;or down there.&rdquo; He threw back his bearish great head
and roared his laughter. &ldquo;We have them cornered, too.&rdquo; Then
suddenly he was scowling again. &ldquo;You dogs of Rome! Throw down
your weapons! Quickly, before we forget ourselves and let our
spears fly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do as he says, men,&rdquo; Cornelius commanded, dropping his
sword. &ldquo;But what do you want?&rdquo; he asked the highwaymen&rsquo;s
leader again. He had decided that the safest course would be to
pretend that he knew nothing of the rebel group, that ruthless
party of guerrilla-fighting revolutionaries known as Zealots who
had sworn not to rest until every imperialist Roman had been
vanquished from their nation&rsquo;s soil. &ldquo;We have brought little
money,&rdquo; he said casually. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t Jews, you know; we aren&rsquo;t
going up to Jerusalem to purchase animals for the Passover sacrifices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The centurion&rsquo;s thrust at the Israelites seemed to incense the
fellow. &ldquo;No, you mongrel of a Roman,&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;nor would
your sacrifice be acceptable to Israel&rsquo;s God were you of a mind to
offer it! Now get down, all you Romans! We&rsquo;re taking your horses.
But you and your woman, Herod, stay where you are. We&rsquo;re taking
you with us for ransom, and if the money isn&rsquo;t quickly forthcoming
to redeem you&rdquo;&mdash;he tugged at his flaring dirt-caked beard
and once again laughed uproariously&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll skin you and one dark
night pin your worthless hides to the door of old Herod&rsquo;s Palace.&rdquo;
But quickly his demeanor changed again. He turned to glare at
his comrades. &ldquo;Get down there and pick up their weapons,&rdquo; he
commanded, &ldquo;and mount the horses. We&rsquo;ve got to be getting
back into the hills. And you, Bildad and Achbor, I&rsquo;ll hold you accountable
for the Tetrarch. Dysmas and Cush, you take charge
of the woman.&rdquo; His sneering countenance softened into an evil
grinning. &ldquo;And see that no harm comes to her. I may wish myself
to examine her seductive charms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antipas sat staring stonily ahead, his countenance a frozen mask
of fear. But anger added a flush to the cheeks of the frightened
Tetrarchess. She did not venture, however, to challenge the man&rsquo;s
insulting remark.</p>
<p>The revolutionaries scampered like sure-footed mountain goats
down from the rocks and quickly assembled the swords that Cornelius&rsquo;
soldiers had thrown to the ground. The leader, who had
stayed in his position atop an overjutting boulder, watched eagle-eyed
along with several of his band who had continued to stand
guard. &ldquo;Issachar, you and Nadab see to the weapons those frightened
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
dogs have thrown down,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;See that not one remains
to them when we&rsquo;re gone. Now, Achbor and you, Bildad,
get started with the Tetrarch, and let the woman follow. Men,
mount the horses&rdquo;&mdash;he paused an instant to watch one of his men
who was having trouble getting into the saddle&mdash;&ldquo;all you who
know how to ride a horse ... and Coz, you don&rsquo;t, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t get away into the rocks with these horses. You
have our swords; why don&rsquo;t you leave us the horses...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let you fly into Jerusalem and have old Pilate&rsquo;s soldiers
combing through the hills for us? Oh, no, Roman dog, we aren&rsquo;t
fools. You&rsquo;ll stand in your tracks until we&rsquo;re gone, or we&rsquo;ll come
charging back and slit your throats and leave you here for the vultures
to clean your bones.&rdquo; He suddenly whirled about, for from
behind him came the sound of men running through the rocks
back from the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romans! Romans!&rdquo; Cornelius heard someone shouting in
Aramaic. &ldquo;Fly! Roman soldiers!&rdquo; In the next instant a bearded,
coarse fellow burst into view above the deep-cut trail. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
stand against them, Bar Abbas; there are too many of them!&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get across the road and into those rocks!&rdquo;
He looked down and spied his companions and their captured
party. &ldquo;The Romans!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Fly men! There are too many
for us to fight them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fly!&rdquo; yelled the gang&rsquo;s leader. &ldquo;Go out through that ravine!&rdquo;
He pointed. &ldquo;Get yourselves lost in the rocks, and hurry!&rdquo; He
turned to the man who had just rushed up to him. &ldquo;How many
did there appear to be, Hamor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many. I could not count them. We speared several before they
discovered us....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fools! If you&rsquo;d held your peace and stayed under cover, they
wouldn&rsquo;t have known you were there. Now you&rsquo;ve caused us to be
flushed out. By the beard of the High Priest, Hamor, haven&rsquo;t I
warned you...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we thought there were only a handful....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through that way!&rdquo; Bar Abbas turned his back toward the
road and was signaling the revolutionaries racing toward him.
Cornelius, who since his first sight of the burly fellow had suspected
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
he was the notorious Zealot marauder, couldn&rsquo;t see the
fleeing Israelites, but he could hear their sandals slapping against
the loose stones. And close behind them&mdash;he was able distinctly to
distinguish the sound of their heavy boots crunching the gravel and
scattering the pebbles&mdash;came the pursuing legionaries of his flanking
file on the west.</p>
<p>Already the assailants in the defile of the road were fleeing.
Some clambered up the steep sides of the little ravine that opened
into the gulch of the roadway and disappeared into the sheltering
boulders above; others ran down the road to the end of the
canyon and turned eastward; several went the other way along the
narrow trail and then turned off in the same direction the others
had taken. But before they had all cleared the road, Bar Abbas and
his companions on the boulders above, still clutching their spears,
had dropped into the defile and without a glance toward their now
liberated prisoners had scampered into the converging ravine.</p>
<p>Hardly had the burly Bar Abbas disappeared before the pursuing
Romans were plunging into the boulders beside the road. In another
moment several of them were peering down into the narrow
roadway. In that same instant Cornelius, looking up, spied Decius.
&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; the centurion called out. &ldquo;Down that way!&rdquo; He pointed.
&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cornelius, by all the gods, you aren&rsquo;t going to let them get
away, are you!&rdquo; screamed Herodias, having suddenly found her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Herodias&rdquo;&mdash;Antipas turned ponderously in his
saddle to face his spouse&mdash;&ldquo;certainly the centurion knows
what....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah! The Tetrarch has come to life! He speaks, now that Bar
Abbas and his revolutionaries have fled,&rdquo; she observed sneeringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bar Abbas,&rdquo; Cornelius said, ignoring the Tetrarchess and Herod,
as Decius and several of his detachment clambered down into the
road. &ldquo;They pounced on us from the rocks there&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed&mdash;&ldquo;and
had us disarmed. I was hoping you would hear the commotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They jumped us the same way, Centurion,&rdquo; Decius said. &ldquo;I
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
think they killed two of our men. I left some men with them. We
got several of the revolutionaries, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a poor exchange. But get after him, Decius. Here, Galba,
Licinius, Mallius&rdquo;&mdash;Cornelius called out a half dozen of the men
who had been in his detachment&mdash;&ldquo;go with them; you saw Bar
Abbas; you&rsquo;ll know him.&rdquo; Already the men were grabbing up their
swords from the pile Bar Abbas&rsquo; men had left in their rush to get
away. &ldquo;They were headed east, toward the Wilderness. In a moment
they&rsquo;ll be running into Lucius on the flank over there. If he
can turn them back, we&rsquo;ll have them in a bag. But they may break
through him. Stay after them, Decius; get that Bar Abbas, and
try to take him alive.&rdquo; He turned to another of his men. &ldquo;Livius,
take a detachment and go down the road; you saw where the
revolutionaries turned off left. Marius, take your squad and go
that way&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed up the Jericho road toward Jerusalem&mdash;&ldquo;and
run down those that fled in that direction; you saw where
they turned off. Follow them. And all of you be careful; we want
no more ambushes.&rdquo; He called out several more names. &ldquo;You men
stay here with me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see that no harm comes to the
Tetrarch and his lady.&rdquo; He smiled wryly as he looked toward
Herodias. &ldquo;We almost didn&rsquo;t do that awhile ago.&rdquo; Then he turned
again to Decius. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re moving out of this trap in here, though,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be up there a thousand paces. And hurry, men; it
will soon be dark in those rocks.&rdquo; He signaled for them to be off.
&ldquo;I want that Bar Abbas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Less than half an hour later Marius and his men returned. They
were leading a manacled Israelite. &ldquo;We saw only five men,&rdquo; Marius
reported. &ldquo;Two of them we killed, and this one we cornered between
two big rocks. The other two slipped away; we searched, but
we&rsquo;re sure they&rsquo;re gone now. This fellow is a Galilean, named
Gesmas, he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you had nobody hurt?&rdquo; Marius nodded. &ldquo;Good. Keep a
sharp eye on this fellow.&rdquo; Cornelius pointed. &ldquo;Livius is coming in.
No prisoners, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Livius reported that his men had killed or wounded several of
the fleeing revolutionaries. He had had only one man cut slightly
by an Israelite&rsquo;s desperately wielded spear; the weapon had grazed
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">254</span>
the soldier&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;We saw no signs of Lucius&rsquo; flanking file,&rdquo;
Livius revealed. &ldquo;They must have been up ahead, and the revolutionaries
we were pursuing must have slipped around their rear.
They know this country; they simply disappeared like conies into
those big rocks. But maybe Lucius intercepted some of those
that Decius went after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; One of the Romans pointed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Decius.&rdquo; Having
moved up from the narrow defile through the boulders, they could
see out on both sides of the road. &ldquo;And he has two prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And one of them, by all the gods&rdquo;&mdash;Cornelius was straining
to see more clearly in the gathering dusk&mdash;&ldquo;is Bar Abbas! Great
Jove, he caught the big prize!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Israelite, too, they discovered in a moment, was a
much wanted revolutionary, one of Bar Abbas&rsquo; principal lieutenants,
a Galilean named Dysmas.</p>
<p>Lucius had stayed out on the flank, Decius explained, to prevent
any sudden desperate attempt of the Zealots to rescue their
leader. They were still no doubt in the rocks back from the road,
perhaps regrouping their scattered forces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From here into Jerusalem the road is clear, and they won&rsquo;t
be able to prepare any ambush.&rdquo; The centurion called out four
soldiers standing near him. &ldquo;Go tell Lucius to come in nearer. We
can move faster that way, and in the deepening darkness it will
be safer for everybody. Tell him we&rsquo;re starting at once for Jerusalem.&rdquo;
As they were leaving, he turned again to Decius. &ldquo;See that
the prisoners are bound securely, and manacle each one between
two of our men. And box them in with guards. Give them no
chance of getting away from us or being rescued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herodias had been watching silently but with evident interest.
&ldquo;It seems to me, Centurion,&rdquo; she observed petulantly, &ldquo;that you
could prevent either eventuality by executing these rebel scum
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a Roman soldier, Tetrarchess. These men have had no
trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to her silent spouse, glumly sitting his horse. &ldquo;He is
the Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea. These revolutionaries are
Galileans. He is the proper one to try them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear Herodias,&rdquo; Antipas spoke out. &ldquo;This is neither the
time nor the place to conduct any trial. Centurion, let us proceed
with your plans to go on into Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herodias lifted her head haughtily, but she made no reply. As
soon as the caravan re-formed and was ready for the march, Cornelius
gave the command to move forward. Less than two hours
later he led the Tetrarch and Tetrarchess through the gate and let
them and their servants into the gloomy pile of the old Hasmonean
Palace. From there he marched his century to the Fortress of Antonia,
where he surrendered his three prisoners to the dungeon
jailer, who locked them, still bound securely, in the darkness and
squalor of one of the lowest-level cells.</p>
<p>When he had seen to the quartering of his men in their Antonia
barracks, he climbed the stone stairway in the southwestern tower
and walked along the corridor to the room he had been assigned
in the officers&rsquo; quarters. He had decided he would have a steaming
bath and put on fresh clothing before going down to the mess
for a late evening meal.</p>
<p>The chamber, the centurion found, was close and warm. He
pushed open the window; then he unbolted the door and walked
out onto the balcony. Down below lights blazed in the Temple
courts, and men scurried to and fro, already in a frenzy of Passover
preparations.</p>
<h2 id="c40">40</h2>
<p>Once again the household of Procurator Pontius Pilate was settled
in the magnificent great Palace of the Herods; once again
the ancient capital of Israel was teeming with countless Jews come
up for the Feast of the Passover.</p>
<p>From every region and hamlet, almost from every home, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
Judaea, Samaria, Peraea, and Galilee, from Antioch, Damascus,
Tarsus, Alexandria, Memphis, and Cyrene, from Ephesus, Athens,
and Corinth, from all provinces rimming the Great Sea, even to
Rome and beyond, from the islands of Cyprus and Sardinia and
Sicily and Crete and those numerous smaller ones dotting the
Aegean, devout Israelites had swarmed into Jerusalem&rsquo;s crowded
narrow ways and squares before the gates.</p>
<p>Every Jewish home, whether pretentious stone residence crowning
Mount Zion or squalid malodorous hovel burrowed beneath
the city&rsquo;s walls in noisome Ophel, was overflowing with pilgrim
kinsmen returned for this greatest annual feast of Israel. For every
person living in Jerusalem, Centurion Longinus casually estimated
as he stood on Fortress Antonia&rsquo;s balcony outside his chamber,
perhaps ten pilgrims had squirmed themselves inside the walls
of the old city. And countless other thousands had been unable
to find living quarters within the walls. Throngs of Passover celebrants
overflowed the slope downward to the Brook Kidron and
up the eastern rise past Gethsemane to the summit of the Mount
of Olives and as far as Bethany. To the south, beyond the ever
smoldering fires of the refuse dumps in the Hinnom valley, and
to the west, tents and brush arbors of Passover pilgrims dotted the
untilled areas through which ran the Bethlehem road. Northward,
too, though Longinus could not survey that section of Jerusalem
and its environs because of the great tower at his back, and to his
right over beyond the massive pile of the Palace of the Herods,
for many furlongs past the Ephraim and Joppa Gates, thin curlings
of grayish-white smoke spiraled upward from small fires over which
Passover pilgrims were bending now in preparation of the evening
meal.</p>
<p>Longinus had been quartered near the Centurion Cornelius, but
he had hardly seen his friend. The night of Cornelius&rsquo; arrival from
Galilee with the Tetrarch&rsquo;s party and his three Zealot prisoners,
they had talked briefly in the mess hall, but they were both weary
from the traveling and soon retired to their beds. The next day
Pontius Pilate, greatly pleased at the capture of the wily zealot
chieftain, had ordered Cornelius to take his century and scour the
rocks above the Jericho road into which the evening before the
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
marauders had disappeared. He had commanded the centurion
to ferret out every member of Bar Abbas&rsquo; band and either capture
or kill him. &ldquo;And follow them as far as Galilee if need be, Centurion,&rdquo;
the Procurator had instructed him. &ldquo;Capture any you can,
and bring them back here; we will crucify them during the Passover
festival, and for the thousands of rebellious, stubborn Jews
who will see them dying on the crosses it will be a salutary lesson.
It may help them realize what fate awaits those who thus oppose
Rome&rsquo;s authority and power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus wondered what success Cornelius was having. Evidently
he had been forced to pursue the fleeing revolutionaries
a long way, perhaps even as far as Galilee, where they might expect
to find haven among kinsmen and friends. No doubt the attackers
of the Tetrarch&rsquo;s party had separated in their flight from
the soldiers of Cornelius. It would be particularly difficult, virtually
impossible, in fact, to round up all the revolutionaries Bar Abbas
had been leading, Longinus felt. In all probability, he reasoned, a
number of them had slipped into Jerusalem a few minutes after
Cornelius had entered the city, perhaps even ahead of his caravan,
and were now safely lost among the tens of thousands deluging
the ancient capital.</p>
<p>Nor had Longinus had an opportunity thus far to spend any
considerable time alone with Claudia. Though Pilate had been
keeping close to his headquarters in the fortress during the day-time,
he had been returning to the palace at night, and his bedchamber
was beside Claudia&rsquo;s and connected with it by a doorway.
The Procurator, too, had issued orders for all officers not on active
duty to be quickly available; Pilate seemed unusually restive. Longinus
felt that Pilate was determined to prevent any small turmoil
among the Jews from developing into a crisis whose handling by
him might further jeopardize his standing with the Prefect Sejanus
and the Emperor. With so many Jews congregated in Israel&rsquo;s holy
city on a festival occasion so characteristically Jewish and one that
so emphasized the peculiarly nationalistic spirit of the Jews, the
situation was always highly inflammable. A small spark, if not
snuffed quickly, could blaze into a holocaust.</p>
<p>One such minor incident that had taken place on the first day
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
of the Jewish week might have provided such a spark, had the
principal actor in it been of a mind to cause trouble. And, strangely,
without having known what he was seeing, Longinus had witnessed
this small happening.</p>
<p>He had breakfasted early with several fellow officers and had
come up to his chamber this particular morning, when, to enjoy
a stirring of the already warming April air, he had stepped out onto
the balcony. Down below him the Court of the Gentiles was a
hive of bustling activity. Out beyond the eastern wall in the direction
he happened to be looking the slopes were alive with pilgrims
preparing for the great festival. But up on the balcony he was safe
from the stir and seething and the interminable chattering of excited
Jewry, and a gentle breeze fanned him. He sat on the wide
stone railing of the rampart, and idly his gaze went down the
nearer slope to the Brook Kidron and along the meandering road
on the other side as it climbed past Gethsemane&rsquo;s olive grove
toward the hill&rsquo;s summit.</p>
<p>It was then that he noticed a procession moving slowly but with
evident enthusiasm downward over this road toward the city from
the direction of Bethany. Immediately his interest was attracted
to the motley parade. Above the harsh cries of the hawkers in
the Temple courts, the quarrelsome tones of bargaining, and the
dull lowing of the cattle in the stalls awaiting sacrificing on the
Great Altar, Longinus could distinguish the screamed hosannas
of this unrestrained movement of dancing, singing, joyous people.
Many of them were waving green branches they must have torn
from trees and shrubs along the roadside. Occasionally the centurion
would catch sight of an erect, tall man astride a white
donkey. He adjudged the man to be tall, because his feet were
not far from the gravel of the road as he sat astride the beast. And
then he would lose sight of the rider as the shouting celebrants
swirled about him.</p>
<p>Some popular rabbi with his people coming up to Jerusalem
for the Passover, Longinus surmised, as he watched the writhing
column approach the Brook Kidron crossing. Soon it disappeared
under the walls down near Dung Gate, but presently it emerged
again into his sight; he followed its progress through the cavernous
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
alleys of Ophel, sometimes seeing it crossing a narrow opening
between huddled buildings but hearing without interruption its
lively shouts and chantings, until it came into clearer view at
a stairway in the street pushing upward along Mount Moriah
toward the Temple now resplendent in the morning sunshine.</p>
<p>Inside the Court of the Gentiles, which the strange little caravan
of one rider and his evidently unorganized but plainly joyous
adherents had reached by coming in through the Gate Shalleketh,
the tall man dismounted, and someone quickly led the little animal
away. In another moment the shouting and hosannas had
ceased, and soon the centurion lost the rider in the press of the
Temple throng.</p>
<p>Later that day in crossing the Court of the Gentiles to go out
through the Gate Shalleketh and onto the bridge over the Tyropoeon,
which was the easiest way to Mount Zion from the fortress,
Longinus learned that the man on the donkey was the rabbi from
Galilee. Many of his followers had expected the rabbi, whose fame
by now had spread throughout Judaea, to come into the precincts
of the Temple, proclaim himself Yahweh&rsquo;s Messiah and the ruler
of the world, and call down legions of heavenly angels utterly to
destroy every vestige of Rome&rsquo;s dominion. Now these followers
were deeply disappointed and utterly chagrined. The tall one
from Galilee in whom they had put their trust, the one who
would be Israel&rsquo;s new David to deliver it from its mighty enemy,
had failed them.</p>
<p>But what if this Jesus had really fancied himself a man ordained
to lead his little nation in throwing off the yoke of Rome? What,
reasoned the centurion, if he had been as visionary, as passionately
though unwisely patriotic as countless other Jews assembled here
in Rome for Israel&rsquo;s great celebration? In this tense, highly inflammable
atmosphere of Passover week in Jerusalem, with great
numbers of his followers believing that he possessed supernatural
authority and powers, the rabbi&rsquo;s willingness to allow himself to be
proclaimed Israel&rsquo;s king would have resulted in fearful bloodshed.
But this Jesus at the last moment had either lost his courage, or
else he had never contemplated leadership of Israel except in some
vague, religious sense that Cornelius perhaps would term spiritual.
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
At any rate, Longinus concluded, the Galilean was no threat to
Rome and of no concern to the Empire. In his report to Sejanus,
he would make no mention of the rabbi, unless in some manner
Pontius Pilate might become involved with the man from Galilee.
He wondered if Pilate had even been informed of the little procession
that had come to such an inglorious ending within the
Temple court. He wondered if Pilate, in fact, in his harried administration
of the affairs of Judaea had ever heard of this Jesus.</p>
<h2 id="c41">41</h2>
<p>Claudia sat on a small stone bench facing one of the fountains
in the garden of the Palace of the Herods. All about her the
grass was a luxuriant green and the flower beds, fed, she had been
told, with blood drained through subterranean pipes from the overflow
of the Great Altar, were already ablaze with color. Birds
skipped and twittered in the rich foliage, and now and then some
venturing small animal would skitter across an open patch of
bright sunshine to disappear beneath the branches of a flowering
shrub. The bench, shaded by a gnarled great olive, was invitingly
cool despite the day&rsquo;s warmth and heaviness, and the gentle babble
of the spraying water ordinarily would have lulled one sitting there
into a mood of peaceful contemplation, if not pleasant slumber.</p>
<p>But this afternoon the wife of the Procurator felt neither peaceful
nor pleasant. She watched the fountain&rsquo;s waters lifting and
arching and falling and draining away in an undeviating pattern
of movement and allowed her own thoughts to wander with it.</p>
<p><i>... There is the picture of my living. Like the water that is the
thrust-along prisoner of the pump, or the ram which again and
again lifts it and sends it spurting upward only to fall back and
sink down and be forced up again, I am the prisoner of some
malign power that pushes me along through a dull monotony of</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">261</span>
<i>days that I am powerless even to protest against; I am swirled
about but held fast like that water in a routine of existence I
dare not even challenge....</i></p>
<p>She leaned forward with her head upon her hands and glared,
hardly seeing it, at the captive, dancing water. How, by Bona Dea
and all the good and gentle gods, the kind and happily ministering
gods, how, by Pluto and all his evil soot-begrimed and blackened
imps, could she escape the treadmill of this deadening monotony,
this unending, bedeviling frustration? Granddaughter of the great
god Augustus, stepdaughter of the great god Tiberius, granddaughter
of the almost-great god Mark Antony and the great great goddess
Cleopatra, wife of the mighty Procurator of Judaea, daughter
through Augustus of Jove himself, princess of the blood....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; She said it aloud. But there was nobody near-by in the
garden. She sat back against the coolness of the stone. &ldquo;By all the
gods, why couldn&rsquo;t I have been a wench serving tables in a tavern,
a strumpet down in the Subura, and had my freedom!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>... Why, by all the gods, can&rsquo;t old Tiberius die? He&rsquo;s past
seventy now, and of what service is he to the Empire? And Sejanus,
the old rake, must be past sixty. If someone would give the Prefect
a neat sword thrust....</i></p>
<p>She stood up and walked over to the fountain, held out her
hands to the spraying water and lifted wet palms to her flushed
cheeks. The afternoon was still and depressing. She raised her eyes
and saw above the trees and the turreted nearest corner of the
great palace rounded soft white puffs of clouds, like newly lifted
fresh curds in a deeply blue overturned bowl. &ldquo;A storm,&rdquo; she said
to herself, &ldquo;one of those swiftly arrived, quickly gone, fierce
Judaean storms. But it will clear the air of this blanket of heat, and
it will serve to break for a while the monotony of another fruitless
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she did not go inside. She sat down again and watched the
gathering puffs of clouds. Never had she been afraid of storms, even
ominous thunder and the swift, sharp streaks of lightning. She
remembered that once in her early childhood when a governess
had warned her against staying outdoors and running the risk of
being struck by one of Jove&rsquo;s hurled mighty bolts, she had remarked,
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
&ldquo;If old Jove is clever enough to strike me with a bolt
outdoors, why can&rsquo;t he throw one right through the roof and hit
me while I&rsquo;m inside? I don&rsquo;t believe he can hit me whether I&rsquo;m
outside or inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her blasphemous words had woefully shocked the governess, but
Claudia had never seen cause to retract them. One thing had led
to another; from denying Jove&rsquo;s power she had soon come to deny
his very existence, and with his, the existence likewise of the entire
pantheon of lesser gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>She was still seated on the bench when a palace servant came
out to announce that a soldier had arrived from Fortress Antonia
with a message for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then bring him here,&rdquo; she instructed the servant. Could it be,
she wondered, that the man is bringing a message from Longinus?</p>
<p>But the legionary had been sent to her by the Procurator. Pilate,
he reported, would not be returning to the palace either for the
evening meal or to spend the night. He begged to explain to his
wife that he had had a very trying day and that he would be engaged
until late in the evening. He had agreed to give an audience
to the High Priest Caiaphas, and their meeting might well be
extended into the night. He had decided, therefore, to forego the
privilege and pleasure of dining with the Procuratoress; he would
have supper in his quarters and after he had ended his long day&rsquo;s
duties would spend the remainder of the night there.</p>
<p>Her first thought was of getting a message to Longinus. She
would write it, seal it fast, and send it by the legionary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said to the soldier. &ldquo;I shall want you to carry
a message to the Fortress.&rdquo; She stood up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go inside and prepare
it.&rdquo; But would it be a discreet thing to do, sending a message
to Longinus by this legionary? What if by chance it should fall
into other hands, even Pilate&rsquo;s? &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no need of my writing
it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just tell the Procurator that I thank him for informing
me and that I shall see him at his pleasure tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she would find a way of notifying Longinus. Tullia. Of
course. Tullia was one person upon whose loyalty and good judgment
she could always depend. When Tullia returned, she would
send her to Longinus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>A soft breeze had sprung up and was pushing the storm clouds
gently away; the air had cooled; the storm seemed to have been
averted for the day. Claudia rose from the bench and returned to
her apartment in the palace.</p>
<p>When a few minutes later her maid returned, she was carrying
a small wicker basket. &ldquo;Mistress, I found these in one of the markets
near the Temple,&rdquo; she said, beaming as she held out the
basket to Claudia. &ldquo;I thought you might enjoy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fresh figs? And so early?&rdquo; She picked one up. &ldquo;It really is a
fresh one, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ve washed them. You can eat it right now. I was
surprised to find any this early, but the man explained that in
some of the warm coves on the protected side of Olivet they often
have figs ripening in early April.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia pulled the fig open and nibbled at the firm reddish
flesh inside. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s delicious,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and such a surprise.&rdquo; She
saw that Tullia&rsquo;s eyes were ablaze with an excitement, however,
that no discovery of fresh figs could have provoked. &ldquo;What is it,
little one? What happened? Whom did you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress, I was looking at the figs when I heard a familiar voice
speaking to the merchant. I looked around; it was Mary of Magdala.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus and his little group, she had told Tullia, had come down
from the Ephraim hills for the Passover. Her master was spending
his nights with Martha and Mary and Lazarus out at near-by
Bethany; during the day he came into the Temple courts to teach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, then, he will proclaim himself the Messiah of Israel
and establish a new government,&rdquo; Tullia said she had said to Mary.
But the Magdalene had answered that Jesus seemed to be insisting
instead that he would not become Israel&rsquo;s temporal ruler, that
he would even die as a sort of Passover sacrifice, an offering for the
salvation of his people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; Claudia commented, &ldquo;you Jews would never so
debase yourselves as to offer a human sacrifice, as do those who
worship Moloch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be that way, Mistress. But ... I don&rsquo;t believe it
will ever happen anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>Mary had asked Tullia to spend the night with her in a cottage
out at Bethany near the modest home of Lazarus and his sisters.
She might be able to see Jesus and even talk with him. They would
meet, if Claudia should be agreeable, at Shushan Gate before sunset
and go out to Bethany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d best be going soon,&rdquo; Claudia observed. &ldquo;But before
you meet Mary, I want you to go by Fortress Antonia and
tell Longinus that the Procurator will be spending the night
there.&rdquo; She told the maid of the message Pilate had sent her. &ldquo;And
tell Longinus I&rsquo;ll accept no excuse for his failing to come.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c42">42</h2>
<p>The lean, blue-jowled ascetic face of Joseph Caiaphas, High Priest
of Israel, warmed into a disarming smile, and the flames from the
chamber&rsquo;s wall lamps danced in his sharp, dark eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must be exasperated at my coming
to you at this late hour.&rdquo; He faced the Procurator across the ornate,
heavy desk. &ldquo;I know you are tired, and I appreciate the fact that
the strain you&rsquo;ve been undergoing ever since your arrival in Judaea
has been intensified during these recent inflammable days of the
Passover season.&rdquo; He leaned nearer Pilate. &ldquo;I realize, too, Excellency,
that you must be determined to prevent the repetition of
events in Palestine that might result in the dispatching to Rome of
further damaging reports&rdquo;&mdash;the Procurator&rsquo;s florid round face
darkened, but Caiaphas pretended not to notice&mdash;&ldquo;challenging the
excellence of the Procurator&rsquo;s administration of the affairs of this
province.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired; I&rsquo;ve had a long day.&rdquo; Pilate&rsquo;s tone revealed irritation.
&ldquo;Perhaps if the High Priest would proceed at once to the
business he had in coming....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Excellency,&rdquo; the High Priest interrupted, &ldquo;and I shall
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
require little of your time, so that shortly you may go to your
well-earned couch. A fortunate event of the day has facilitated the
early satisfactory disposition of the business; if the Procurator will
co-operate in disposing of it we shall quickly rid ourselves of a
grievous threat both to Israel&rsquo;s peace and to the Procurator&rsquo;s rule.
I have just come from a lengthy session of the elders of Israel,
Excellency&mdash;that explains my late arrival here&mdash;at which we have
agreed....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is the business you would lay before me? And how
would it affect the Procurator&rsquo;s administration of the government
in Judaea?&rdquo; Pilate&rsquo;s impatience had put a sharp edge on his voice.
&ldquo;If it is a question of the alleged violation of certain religious laws
of the Jews....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that, Excellency, but it is more.&rdquo; Caiaphas leaned forward,
and the light of the lamps flashed in the gems of his rings. &ldquo;Not
only would this man destroy our religion, but likewise would he
destroy the rule of Rome in Palestine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man? Are you speaking of one Bar Abbas? He has been
seized, with two of his fellow revolutionaries. They go to the cross
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The High Priest shook his head. &ldquo;It is not that one, Excellency.
The man is a Galilean, one Jesus bar Joseph, not a robber like
Bar Abbas, but a far more dangerous revolutionary, whom his misguided
followers&mdash;and their number is growing, Excellency&mdash;are
proclaiming not only the Messiah of God but also the next King
of Israel. Were noise to get back to the Prefect Sejanus or the
Emperor that such a person was being permitted to advocate and
plan Rome&rsquo;s overthrow and your Excellency&rsquo;s supplanting....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But does the High Priest know where this man is? Does the
Sanhedrin have him in its custody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calmly Joseph Caiaphas stroked his oiled and braided long
beard. &ldquo;He is in Jerusalem at this moment, Excellency, or within
the close environs of the city. It is possible that already he has
been seized by the Temple guard. He has been at the Feast since
the first day of the week when he entered Jerusalem riding on a
white donkey, which among the Jews is a symbol of royalty, Excellency.
It was then that he had planned to enlist the Passover
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
pilgrims, led by his fellow Galileans, in proclaiming him the new
David, the King of Israel suddenly freed of Rome&rsquo;s domination.
He lost his courage, though, or in some manner his plans failed of
materialization. But&rdquo;&mdash;his hand stabbed out again at the Procurator&mdash;&ldquo;the
fellow is still intent on seizing power, and his countless
misguided followers are determined to see him established on the
throne as King of Israel. They will plunge our ancient land into
revolution, Excellency. Blood will flow freely throughout Judaea
and Galilee. Many Roman soldiers will die before the rebellion is
crushed, unless&rdquo;&mdash;his forehead wrinkled in heavy concern&mdash;&ldquo;this
fellow is quietly slain, Excellency, before his followers can rally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that perhaps he has been arrested already. How could
he be taken without alarming these supporters of whom you
speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The High Priest leaned back in his chair and folded his long
arms across his chest. &ldquo;The God of Israel has favored us, Excellency.
He has delivered this blasphemer into our hands through
his betrayal by one of his own band. This man came to us and
after seeking pay told us he would point out where the man might
be found and taken with little commotion. We gave the fellow
thirty pieces of silver. By now no doubt he has delivered his leader
into the hands of the guardsmen....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say this man&rsquo;s a blasphemer. Don&rsquo;t you know that the
Procurator is not concerned with violations of your religious code?
What is it to Rome if your Yahweh is blasphemed? We will not
enter into the religious quarrels of the Jews. I presume you have
come here to ask me to try the man and find him guilty. I say, O
High Priest, try the man yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caiaphas smiled indulgently, but then his brow furrowed again
and he scowled darkly. &ldquo;That is true, Excellency. Rome has no
concern with Israel&rsquo;s worship of our God. But is not Rome concerned
when a man, under the guise of teaching a new religion,
declares openly that he will establish a new government in Israel?
Would not Sejanus and the Emperor consider then that Rome was
concerned ... and deeply concerned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The High Priest&rsquo;s clever thrust had made its mark; Pilate&rsquo;s face
flushed; his tone, when he replied, was petulant. &ldquo;Of course, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
Prefect and the Emperor would be concerned; so would the Legate
Vitellius, and so would the Procurator; so, in fact, would any loyal
Roman.&rdquo; Now the Procurator extended his own finger to point.
&ldquo;But how do you know that this Galilean advocates the overthrow
of Rome? Has he come to trial? Has he faced witnesses
against him? What would the High Priest have me to do, send a
man to his death without trial? Certainly the High Priest must
know that Rome is ruled by law, that no man under the rule of
Rome may suffer death until he has been adjudged guilty, and
that any such judgment can come only after a fair trial in which
the man has been confronted by witnesses against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, O Procurator&rdquo;&mdash;Joseph Caiaphas held up a soothing
palm&mdash;&ldquo;we well know that and approve. We, too, would never
consent to sending this revolutionary to his death without trial,
even though his crimes against Israel and against Rome have already
been conclusively established. But he is being brought to
fair trial, Excellency, before the great Sanhedrin of Israel. Perhaps
he has already been apprehended in the Garden of Gethsemane,
where he had planned to conceal himself with certain of his followers,
as we learned from the traitor who came to us. He will be
examined, no doubt before my beloved father-in-law Annas, known
for his piety and his wisdom, learned in the laws of Israel&rdquo;&mdash;he
smiled warmly&mdash;&ldquo;and strong in his devotion to the Prefect and the
Emperor. And then, Excellency, as soon as the dawn of the new
day makes it legal under our laws to conduct such a trial, the Galilean
will be brought before the Sanhedrin, confronted by witnesses
against him, and given proper trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why has the High Priest,&rdquo; Pilate asked in exasperation,
&ldquo;come to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Excellency, the Procurator must know that the ancient laws
of Israel, now that Rome has become master, no longer apply in
every detail. Should our Sanhedrin find this revolutionary Galilean
guilty of base crimes and sentence him to death, it would still be
powerless to carry out its sentence without the approval of Rome.
I am here, O Excellency, to petition the Procurator to approve
our verdict and sentence. And I urge you to do this quickly, in
order that the man may be executed while it is yet early and
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">268</span>
before all Jerusalem, and the Galileans in particular, are astir. Then
much commotion and bloodshed would be prevented and,&rdquo; he
added with a suggestive smile, &ldquo;there would be no necessity of any
report&rsquo;s going to Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you wish me to condemn a man to death <i>before</i> he has
been tried?&rdquo; Pilate&rsquo;s anger showed plainly in his frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no, Excellency,&rdquo; the High Priest replied calmly. &ldquo;We
only wish you to approve and order into execution the sentence
of the Sanhedrin in the event that <i>after</i> he has been tried, he is
judged guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate shook his head. &ldquo;No, I shall send no man to the cross
or to death by stoning until <i>I</i> have tried him. To do so would be
an unspeakable breach of Rome&rsquo;s system of justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Excellency, would you show your scorn of Israel&rsquo;s highest
court?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would show only my determination to uphold Rome&rsquo;s laws
and procedures. If you wish this man tried, then bring him before
me at the Procuratorium.&rdquo; He bowed coldly. &ldquo;And now, if
the High Priest will excuse me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The High Priest stood up as though to leave. &ldquo;Indeed, Excellency,
I too am greatly fatigued,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but one more point
detains me. A moment ago, Procurator Pilate, did I not hear you
say that on the morrow you were sending Bar Abbas to the cross?
If so, Excellency, have you not already convicted him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate&rsquo;s smile was contemptuous as he, too, rose to his feet. &ldquo;I
did say that, and I have no doubt that he will go to the cross. But
not, O High Priest, until he has been given trial, before he has
been confronted by witnesses who will testify to what they saw and
heard as concerns those charges that will be placed against him.
I presume that many will appear against this Bar Abbas and that
he will be convicted. But I do not say now that he will. I say
only that he will be given a fair trial.&rdquo; He lifted a heavy fist and
brought it forcefully down upon the surface of his desk. &ldquo;And so,
by all the gods, will your Galilean!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<h2 id="c43">43</h2>
<p><i>... The knocking is insistent. Can it be that the Praetorian
Guardsman has been there a long time pounding on the door between
the atrium and the peristylium while I slowly awakened?
Bona Dea, what can old Sejanus want this time? Will he never
cease hounding Longinus and me?</i></p>
<p><i>... Longinus. By the Bountiful Mother, maybe it&rsquo;s Longinus
returned from Germania. Maybe he&rsquo;s at the bedroom door opening
on the peristylium....</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, Centurion, until I get my robe!&rdquo; Claudia sat
up in bed, rubbed her eyes, and shook her head to clear it. A
narrow slash of natural light showed through the not completely
drawn draperies. It was dawn. And burrowed in the pillow beside
her was the close-cropped head of the Centurion Longinus.</p>
<p>Now the knocking had begun again. But it came, Claudia
realized, from the other side of the door between her bedroom
and Tullia&rsquo;s. And though insistent, the knocking was not loud.
&ldquo;Mistress! Mistress! Oh, Mistress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She recognized her maid&rsquo;s voice; Tullia was trying to awaken
her without making too much noise in the early morning stillness
of the Palace of the Herods. &ldquo;Just a moment, little one,&rdquo; she
called out softly. At the door she slid back the bolt. &ldquo;But, Tullia,&rdquo;
she demanded, keeping her voice low so that she would not awaken
Longinus, &ldquo;what are you doing back so early? It must be hardly
daylight. Why, little one....&rdquo; she paused, seeing the maid on
the verge of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mistress, he&rsquo;s in grave danger!&rdquo; Tullia burst out. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
seized him. We fear great harm may befall him. That&rsquo;s why I have
come back to seek your help for him.&rdquo; She was making an obvious
effort to gain control of herself; somewhat calmed, she continued.
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
&ldquo;I started from Bethany at the first glimmering of light, almost as
soon as we heard that he had been taken. We&rsquo;re so afraid, Mistress,
that great harm will come to him unless....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down&rdquo;&mdash;Claudia&rsquo;s tone was soothing&mdash;&ldquo;and then
quietly you can tell me why you&rsquo;re so afraid he&rsquo;s going to suffer
great injury. And who, Tullia? You haven&rsquo;t even told me his
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Galilean, Mistress; I thought you knew. Sometime during
the night some Temple guardsmen came and seized him in the
Garden of Gethsemane; he&rsquo;d gone there with his little band to
rest after eating the Passover meal at the home of Mary of Cypress.
They say it was one of his own band who betrayed him,
who told the Temple priests where he could be found and arrested
without there being a big stir. Of course there would have
been a great commotion if they had tried to take him anywhere
near the Temple; they wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to do such a thing
if....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you know all this?&rdquo; Claudia interrupted. &ldquo;Maybe
you&rsquo;re getting yourself upset without good reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s true, Mistress. Jesus and those of his immediate company,
along with his mother and certain other relatives, have been
staying in the Bethany neighborhood during the festival period,&rdquo;
Tullia revealed. &ldquo;Jesus himself lodged at the home of Lazarus and
his sisters. But yesterday afternoon the Master and the twelve
men of his band went into Jerusalem. That&rsquo;s the last time Mary
of Magdala saw him.&rdquo; Her face was a mask of pain and apprehension.
&ldquo;Then, early this morning, we were awakened by several of
his band who had come running back to Bethany in great panic
to report what had befallen him. All of them forsook him in the
garden when the soldiers appeared; even Simon, after he had
slashed out with his sword at one of the guardsmen, turned on his
heel and ran, too, they said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did the soldiers take him?&rdquo; Claudia asked. &ldquo;And
why have you come to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said there was talk that he was being taken before the
High Priest or else old Annas, Mistress. And we&rsquo;re afraid that he
may suffer a terrible fate if he falls into the hands of the Temple
<span class="pb" id="Page_271">271</span>
priests. They&rsquo;re determined to kill him, Mistress.&rdquo; She paused,
eyes tearful. &ldquo;I knew no one else to whom I could turn for help,
no one but you. I thought that you might speak to the Procurator
and he might rescue the Galilean before they have him killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you know that they have no authority to execute the
death sentence until the Procurator has given approval?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they&rsquo;re so inflamed against him, Mistress, that they
might risk it. But if you could send a message to the Procurator....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was probably up late into the night. To awaken him now
with a message might offend him, and that would be doing the
Galilean more harm than good. But Pilate usually returns to the
palace before beginning his morning duties; as soon as he does,
I&rsquo;ll lay before him this matter of the Galilean&rsquo;s arrest. Certainly no
harm can come to him before Pilate has had an opportunity to sit
in judgment on him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c44">44</h2>
<p>This Passover season there would be only three burdened crosses
on top of the desolate Hill of the Skull, but they would be
enough. The ugly spectacle would provide a frightful ending to
the Jews&rsquo; annual great festival.</p>
<p>In other times in Palestine, Centurion Cornelius had been told,
Rome had moved swiftly&mdash;and with far more terrifying effectiveness&mdash;to
dramatize the utter futility of any province&rsquo;s attempt to
contend against the mighty conqueror. In Galilee they still talked,
though even now in carefully guarded conversations, of that dreadful
day at Sepphoris hardly more than twenty years ago when the
Roman general Varus had crushed a rebellion and crucified two
thousand Jewish insurrectionists.</p>
<p>Perhaps Pontius Pilate, who a week ago had sent him chasing
the rebels of the now leaderless Bar Abbas band, had tired of
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
awaiting the centurion&rsquo;s return with more captives for the crosses;
perhaps he had already ordered to slow and agonizing deaths the
revolutionaries&rsquo; leader and the two followers captured with him. It
might be that even now countless pilgrims up for the Passover,
drawn by a morbid fascination, were gawking at the scourged, torn,
and broken, unimaginably desecrated bodies of the captured robber-Zealots.
But Cornelius would provide no additional victims for
those crosses on the Hill of the Skull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he said aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Centurion? Glad?&rdquo; Decius, riding beside him, had
heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking aloud about this business of crucifying
slaves and depraved criminals. I was glad those four revolutionaries
we cornered in the Ephraim hills chose to fight to their deaths
rather than surrender. It&rsquo;s better not having to take anybody back
to Jerusalem to be nailed up on a cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not one of the most pleasant assignments a soldier gets, being
on a crucifixion detail,&rdquo; Decius agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on three, and
I&rsquo;ll never forget those poor devils, the first one especially, maybe
just because he was my first. He was a boy in Germania, hardly
sixteen, but a sturdy, strong fellow. I can still see him, Centurion.
He was fair and his hair was the color of ripened grain, and
his eyes were as blue as the sky. He had killed one of our soldiers,
they said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably after our soldier had killed the boy&rsquo;s parents and
raped his sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say as to that; you could be right, Centurion. But our
commander ordered him to the cross, and I was put on the detail.
We took that boy and tied him to the low stake and scourged him
until he was a bloody pulp, Centurion. I can still see those bone-tipped
whips slashing that white skin and flicking off bits of flesh,
and one of them got him in the eye and knocked the ball out of
the socket; it was hanging down when we nailed him up.&rdquo; Decius
shook his head ruefully. &ldquo;By the gods, Centurion, do you know
that boy even then fought us and cursed us as long as he had a
hand or foot loose, and when we got all four spiked down he
tried to butt us with his head. He was a strong one, that fellow;
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
I remember he didn&rsquo;t die until well along in the second day, and
then he was spitting at us and cursing us almost to his last breath.&rdquo;
Decius stared thoughtfully for a moment at the road unwinding
ahead. &ldquo;Many times I&rsquo;ve dreamed about that boy, Centurion, and
I can still see him plainly and hear his screaming and cursing. It&rsquo;s
not a pleasant dream. I&rsquo;d rather dream about those yellow-haired
women in Germania.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius nodded his head solemnly. &ldquo;Yet we Romans call ourselves
modern and civilized people.&rdquo; They rode on in silence for
a few moments. &ldquo;Maybe we did well in being away from Jerusalem
most of the week of the feast,&rdquo; Cornelius finally commented.
&ldquo;Maybe we escaped being assigned by the Procurator to
a crucifixion detail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so; I&rsquo;ve no stomach for serving on one again,&rdquo; Decius
agreed. &ldquo;You know, Centurion, I&rsquo;ve just been thinking that very
likely many of Bar Abbas&rsquo; cutthroats are right up there in Jerusalem
in that Passover crowd. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if some of
them should try to rescue those three Zealots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius nodded. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me either. I suspect
that most of them, in fact, doubled back that night and beat us
into Jerusalem and got themselves quickly lost in the surge of
Passover pilgrims. And only the gods know how many other Zealots
are swarming all over the city with their daggers sharpened for
our throats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was almost midday when they moved through the defile between
the boulders where a week before they had been waylaid
by the Zealot chieftain. This time Cornelius sent a scouting party
ahead to reconnoiter. But no marauder was encountered.</p>
<p>In the level beyond the rocks the century paused to eat and
rest. But not for long. Soon Cornelius gave the order to reassemble
in marching formation. The sun was straight overhead, and the
air was warm and heavy; a stifling stillness presaged a violent storm.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get into Antonia before it breaks,&rdquo; the centurion observed
to Decius, as they mounted their horses. &ldquo;Look.&rdquo; He
pointed off toward the southwest where an immense angry black
cloud hovered low. &ldquo;By mighty Jove, it must be already dark in
Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<h2 id="c45">45</h2>
<p>The tall Galilean arose from the steps before the Beautiful Gate
and bending over, caught the hand of the prostrate, frightened
woman. &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you, my sister,&rdquo; he said gently, as
he helped her to her feet and she lifted tearful, penitent eyes to
him. &ldquo;Go, and sin no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is truly a good man, Tullia, a noble man of warm heart, a
generous, forgiving, good man. But a god? No, little one.&rdquo; They
were watching the woman as she neared the corner of the Chel
toward the Fortress of Antonia. &ldquo;There are no gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman went out of their sight around the Soreg. They
turned to look again toward the Galilean at the marble steps.</p>
<p>But the steps had disappeared, and the Beautiful Gate, and beyond
it the Great Altar. Only the man stood there, and his arms
were bound behind him now, and where the Chel had been was
the Procurator&rsquo;s tribunal. Solemn but unafraid, he faced the judge.
At his back the Temple leaders who a moment ago had dragged
the poor woman before him were shouting execrations upon him
and demanding of the Procurator his crucifixion. &ldquo;Crucify him!&rdquo;
they were screaming. &ldquo;Crucify him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the magistrate&rsquo;s chair ... by the Great Mother, there
was Pontius Pilate!</p>
<p>Pilate, his round face livid with anger, was remonstrating with
the priests. &ldquo;But shall I crucify your King? Shall I crucify the
King of the Jews?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crucify Jesus of Galilee?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Pilate! No! No!&rdquo; She was running toward the Procurator
to stand beside the Galilean. &ldquo;No, my husband, have nothing to
do with this good man!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>... But Pilate does not see me or hear me. Nor does the Galilean.
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
Am I a disembodied spirit? But there are no spirits. Oh,
Tullia. But Tullia neither hears nor sees me....</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take him yourselves and crucify him. His death be your
responsibility.&rdquo; Pilate was speaking again. &ldquo;I am free of his blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! No, Pilate! You are sending an innocent man to his
death! You can never disavow responsibility! Oh, hear me, my
husband! Hear me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Praetorium and its tribunal, the tall, bound Galilean,
the railing priests and their blood-hungry supporters were suddenly
vanished.</p>
<p>The great throne room of the Imperial Palace in Rome was
strangely darkened. She could hear the voice of the Emperor, but
she could hardly distinguish his features. Was he her stepfather
Tiberius, incredibly old now, or a younger Emperor? The voice was
somewhat strange, too. &ldquo;You have failed miserably,&rdquo; the voice was
saying. &ldquo;You have been rash and stubbornly determined to govern
in accordance with your own whims, you have not only permitted,
but you have, through your intemperate governing, created much
turmoil and insurrection within your province; in short, your rule
has been a travesty of Roman administration.&rdquo; The voice paused.
&ldquo;But I shall not order you executed, as you deserve. Instead, I
decree that you be banished, forthwith and forever....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice had faded out as the light came up, and she saw standing
with bowed head, old and bent and his once round face
thinned and haggard and hopeless, Pontius Pilate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! If you had only listened....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no one heard her, and the great chamber was dark, and not
a sound came to her out of the stillness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the Great Mother! By all the gods, great and small. Oh,
Galilean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now as she stood immobile and weightless in the blackness and
silence, she began to sense a luminosity thinning the darkness
below, and looking down she saw a great way off a point of light
that spread and lifted and came up in ever widening circles to
illuminate the heights about her. For she was standing on the
summit of a great mountain, higher even than the sun-baked
granite bluffs on which Machaerus sat above the Dead Sea, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
far below she could discern the imprisoned, restless waters of a
mountain-rimmed small lake.</p>
<p>Then, as she raised her eyes from the waters and looked across
toward an opposite peak, she saw him. He stood, bent and
shrunken and old with the weight of centuries, on a jagged thrust
of rock that came out from the mountain to overhang the agitated
surface of the lake. He was looking down at the waters; the
light was reflected from a head completely bald, and it played on
cheek bones guarding cheeks long sunken, so that his head even
in life appeared to have dried away to a skull, and only long dewlaps
hanging down showed signs of animation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! It cannot be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she knew it was, though Pontius Pilate had shriveled into
a pitiful husk of the vain and pompous Procurator he had been.</p>
<p>In the same moment she heard voices, and looking around, she
saw people on the slopes of the mountain, coming up, pushing
outward, swelling, and growing until all the mountain was filled
with people, and they were of all races and times and colors and
tongues. But strangely enough, she could understand their words,
Roman and Greek and Egyptian and the tongues of the yellow-haired
sons of Germania and the dark-haired women of Gaul, and
even the babblings of the barbarians in faraway Britannia, and
the curious utterances of the many unborn strange peoples of
places beyond the as yet uncharted seas. And each in his own
way was saying what all the others were saying.</p>
<p>The man on the precipice appeared not to see or hear the
people; he seemed preoccupied, fearful, oblivious of everything
about him, and struggling with the burden of some monstrous
inner distress. He raised his hands and held them before his face,
and then it was that she saw they were red to the wrists with the
color of blood freshly spilled; he rubbed them together, as though
struggling fiercely to scrub the blood away; he lowered them as if
to dip them in a basin, then lifted them again to study them, his
bloodless face, in contrast to the hands, a shade of ashen horror.</p>
<p>But the frenzied washing had done no good; the hands shone
fiery red. Despairing, Pilate dropped them to his sides and stepped
to the very edge of the yawning gulf. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; he cried.
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
&ldquo;By all the gods, I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He raised his cavernous face and
with eyes wide looked into the void. &ldquo;O God of the Jews&rdquo;&mdash;his
shrunken head swayed on the wrinkled neck&mdash;&ldquo;had I but known.
Had I but known....&rdquo; His words whispered into silence, and he
closed his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! No! No!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She forced herself to look down.</p>
<p>Pilate&rsquo;s lean frame was dropping, slowly turning and twisting,
toward the angry waters; his bony arms and legs were thrust out
stiffly from the shroud of his too large toga, which streamed above
the plummeting body, flapping furiously in the wind. Rigid with
horror, staring into the abyss, she saw the body strike, heard the
sickening blob, and watched it gradually disappear.</p>
<p>But the waters would not grant oblivion. Angrily they flung
the broken, thin body back to the surface, and to Claudia, watching
in frozen fascination, it seemed to be twisting and eddying
in continuous agitation above the seething waters. Looking more
closely, her eyes rooted to the scene in morbid horror, she saw
white arms thrust upward and hands still reddened, cleansed not
one tint by their plunge into the watery depths. Now suddenly
the hands seemed detached from the stiffening arms, and alive;
like wounded rodents seeking haven in a dark fissure among the
rocks, they were feeling their way along the ascending stony slope
toward her, and in that dreadful instant there lifted to her also
the babble of countless voices in many tongues blending once
again into a swelling chorus. The light breaking slowly above the
mountain showed the plain below and the steep rises teeming
with a multitude drawn from all races and nations.</p>
<p>On the faces of some she read swift anger and deep hate, and
their fists were lifted skyward and their voices raised in execrations;
others revealed only indifference, and their words were but the
prattled monotony of chanted creed; but here and there on the
level and along the slopes she saw those whose words fitted without
disharmony into the growing chorus but whose faces as they
uttered them revealed sorrow, deep pity, and a forgiving spirit.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes against the vision of the myriad chanting
faces, but she heard their voices and she understood their many
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
tongues ... &ldquo;Crucified by Pontius Pilate ... Crucified ... suffered
under Pontius Pilate ... suffered ... suffered ... Pontius
Pilate....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; She opened her eyes to see the mountain cleared of
the people, the vision gone, the voices silenced. But there on the
ledge at her feet, rubbing one against the other, endlessly, eternally,
fruitlessly seeking to be cleansed, were the two gory, dismembered
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Back! Back! Go back!&rdquo; She whirled about to rid herself of
the frightening apparition, and burying her face, eyes shut, against
her crossed arms, she leaned down upon the cool hardness of the
boulder beside her. &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Get back! Go! Please
go!&rdquo; Would those hands, the horrible thought came suddenly to
her, come closer? Would they attempt to exact vengeance upon
her? Might they even now be creeping upon her to fasten cold,
bloody fingers about her neck, to choke the life...?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back! No! No!&rdquo; she screamed, as she freed an arm to beat
frantic fist against the stone. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me! Tullia! Longinus!
Oh, Longinus....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claudia! By great Jove!&rdquo; The centurion, sitting up fully awake,
shook her hard. &ldquo;Claudia! Wake up, woman! Wake up! Come out
of it! What on earth....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened her eyes. &ldquo;Longinus! Oh, by all the gods, it was
terrible, terrible!&rdquo; Nor was the terror completely dispelled; in her
eyes, wide, staring, her fear still spoke. Her shoulders shook in an
involuntary shudder.</p>
<p>He pulled her up into a sitting position and grasped her hand.
&ldquo;But it was only a nightmare, Claudia. You&rsquo;re all right. You were
just dreaming.&rdquo; She blinked and ventured a thin smile. &ldquo;You
were screaming like a wild woman and beating the bed with your
fist.&rdquo; His excited concern gave way to a grin. &ldquo;It must have been
a bloodcurdling dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Longinus&rdquo;&mdash;she clenched her eyelids tightly against the
light streaming in through the window&mdash;&ldquo;it was the most horrible
dream I ever had, the most frightful thing anyone could imagine.
I dreamed ... oh, it&rsquo;s too horribly near; I can&rsquo;t tell you now.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
Still shaking, she turned to snuggle within the haven of his arms.
&ldquo;Bona Dea....&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden light knocking on the door interrupted her. Tullia
entered to ask softly if anything was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only a nightmare, little one,&rdquo; Claudia answered, leaning
back on her pillow. &ldquo;It was so vivid, so frightening. But I&rsquo;m all
right now. I&rsquo;ll call you when I need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it about what I told you, Mistress, the Galilean?&rdquo; Her
question and tone of voice betrayed Tullia&rsquo;s deep concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes ... about him and Pilate; horrible, horrible. I....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mistress, could it have been a message to you, a vision
sent...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your Jewish Yahweh, perhaps?&rdquo; Claudia affected an uneasy
laugh. &ldquo;No, it was a dream, little one, that&rsquo;s all. Get back to
your bed; you must still be weary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia saw Longinus&rsquo; look of puzzlement. &ldquo;Tullia returned
late in the night from Bethany and reported that the High Priest
had schemed the arrest of the rabbi of Galilee. She was afraid he
might prevail on Pilate this morning to agree to the crucifixion of
the Galilean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crucifixion? By all the gods, on what charge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he seeks to overthrow Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Galilean? But he&rsquo;s no revolutionary. Surely Pilate knows
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, surely he must.&rdquo; She frowned. &ldquo;But you know how Pilate
fears the High Priest and his Temple crowd, how he&rsquo;s always
afraid they&rsquo;ll send reports to Sejanus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you dreamed that he had sent the Galilean to the cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was all confused, all horrible.&rdquo; She sat up precipitately
and looked toward the window. &ldquo;Bona Dea, it must be late. And
Pilate begins his trials soon after daybreak. Mother Ceres, I do
wonder....&rdquo; She sprang from the bed and drew on her robe.
&ldquo;Tullia!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Fetch me a wax tablet and stylus! Hurry,
little one! I must send Pilate a message.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<h2 id="c46">46</h2>
<p>The sun was lifting above the Mount of Olives when Pilate&rsquo;s
orderly awakened him from heavy sleep. &ldquo;Sir, the High Priest
Caiaphas and others of the Temple leadership,&rdquo; he said apologetically,
&ldquo;insisted that I inform you that they have arrived with
the prisoner about whom he spoke with you last night. They said
that they were most anxious for you to proceed at once to dispose
of the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Procurator sat up in bed and blinked his heavy-lidded eyes.
&ldquo;Insolent Jew!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;He would not only tell the Procurator
what to do, but when to do it! By the great Jove, I may
surprise him!&rdquo; He threw back the covering and rose ponderously
to his feet. &ldquo;Go tell the High Priest to have his witnesses ready.
I shall be there shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great Fortress of Antonia, Rome&rsquo;s bastion in the Jerusalem
region, consisted actually of four straight-walled, high buildings
joined together by corner towers to compose an impregnable stone
structure some fifty by one hundred paces on the outside walls.
The space within the inside four walls had been paved with great
stone slabs to form a tremendous courtyard reached by huge gateways,
one on each of the edifice&rsquo;s four sides. Massive gates guarded
the fortress against sudden attack; when opened, they admitted a
flow of nondescript traffic into the courtyard.</p>
<p>Along the southern side of the fortress there was another paved
court from which a wide flight of stone steps led up to a terrace;
the terrace, in turn, led into the interior courtyard. In a high-ceilinged
chamber on the ground floor of this structure, Pontius
Pilate had set up his Praetorium. A Roman praetorium, or trial
place of a praetor, consisted of a semicircular dais on which the
curule, or magistrate&rsquo;s chair, had been placed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>In the rear of this chamber was a small doorway, and it was
through this doorway that Pilate, shortly after the orderly had
reported to High Priest Caiaphas, came into the Praetorium.</p>
<p>The Procurator strode straight to the dais, mounted its several
steps, and sat down on the curule. Frowning, he glanced toward
the tall, manacled prisoner. Flanking the man on both sides were
several guards, all Roman soldiers, who had been assigned to the
Temple detail. Though a throng had already assembled in the
court beyond the gateway, the Procurator could see from where he
sat on the tribunal that not a Jew had followed the prisoner inside
the vaulted chamber. &ldquo;What charge is brought against this man?&rdquo;
Pilate snapped. &ldquo;And where are his accusers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain of the guard saluted. &ldquo;High Priest Caiaphas commanded
me, Excellency, to bring the prisoner before you with instructions
that he has been tried before the Jewish Sanhedrin and
found guilty of crimes punishable by death. He said you, O Excellency,
were to confirm the verdict of the Jewish court and order
its sentence put into execution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anger suffused the Procurator&rsquo;s round, usually bland face. &ldquo;And
why hasn&rsquo;t the High Priest come himself to bear witness to the
Sanhedrin&rsquo;s action? Why has this man no accusers confronting
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain was plainly ill at ease. He shifted his weight from
one foot to the other, started to speak, then swallowed. &ldquo;The
Jews, O Excellency, will not enter the Praetorium for fear that to
do so will be a profanation, that it will render them unfit to eat
of their Passover evening meal,&rdquo; he finally revealed. &ldquo;They will
come no nearer than the steps&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed&mdash;&ldquo;out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate, as the captain had expected, was furious. &ldquo;Profanation!
Profanation! All I hear in this rebellious, proud province is profanation!
Hah! They would profane themselves by entering a
Roman hall of justice!&rdquo; His already flushed cheeks were purpling.
He stood up quickly, strode down the steps of the tribunal, and
stalked forward to the stairway; from there he could survey the
mass of excited, chattering Jews, who quieted perceptibly on seeing
him emerge from the Praetorium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prisoner,&rdquo; he said, motioning with his head toward the
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
chamber from which he had just come, &ldquo;what charge do you bring
against him? And where are his accusers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The multitude was silent. Eyes turned toward a group near the
foot of the steps; in the center of the knot stood the High Priest.
He advanced a pace and bowed to the Procurator. &ldquo;O Excellency,
this man has been tried by our Sanhedrin and found guilty of
grievous crimes. If he had not been found to be a criminal of
desperate wickedness, then we would not have brought him before
the Procurator to be sentenced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bold insolence of the High Priest&rsquo;s reply did not escape
Pilate. &ldquo;If you have tried him then and found him guilty, why
don&rsquo;t you also take him and execute upon him your sentence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caiaphas stood silent for a moment. &ldquo;But the Procurator must
know, O Excellency,&rdquo; he replied at length, a humorless smile lifting
the corners of his mouth, &ldquo;that under the dominion of Rome
the Sanhedrin has not the authority, however heinous the criminal&rsquo;s
deeds may have been, to execute upon him the sentence of
death. Therefore, O sir, we petition the Procurator to order executed
upon this vicious criminal the sentence of death which the Sanhedrin
has found him so fully to deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Pilate was obdurate. &ldquo;You would ask a Roman magistrate
to find a man guilty and send him to the cross, even though no
accusation had been made against him and no witnesses had confronted
him,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that were I to do so
I would violate every principle of Roman justice?&rdquo; He jabbed a
pudgy forefinger toward Caiaphas. &ldquo;Would you, O High Priest,
ask the Procurator thus to violate his oath as Rome&rsquo;s regent in
Judaea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Procurator, however, had failed to gauge the High Priest&rsquo;s
cunning. &ldquo;Indeed, O Excellency, of course I would not seek to
lead the Procurator into violating his oath to uphold Roman justice.&rdquo;
He smiled and bowed, mockingly. &ldquo;Nor would I stand
silent and unprotesting while the Procurator released a clever
though iniquitous criminal who seeks not only the demoralization
of Israel&rsquo;s religion and the perversion of her people but also the
overthrow of Rome in this province and the establishment of himself
as King of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>The High Priest&rsquo;s answer was not only a skilful parry of the
Procurator&rsquo;s question but it was, moreover, a well-aimed thrust
of his own most effective weapon. Caiaphas knew that Pilate lived
always in mortal fear of being reported to Rome; he knew that
the Procurator would not dare to ignore any situation in Judaea,
or even the hint of it, that might be fostering incipient revolt
against Roman rule.</p>
<p>But Pilate maintained his composure; he would not yield obsequiously
to this hateful symbol of Jewry&rsquo;s stubborn pride of race
and nationality and her cold scorn of everything Roman. He
studied the group for whom the High Priest professed to be speaking;
it was a nondescript assemblage, Temple hirelings, a knot
of Pharisees, and surrounding the High Priest himself, his own
Sadducean coterie; the others were, for the most part, sunburnt
fellows who might well be, the thought came to him suddenly,
Galilean and Judaean revolutionaries come in for the Passover
feast from their mountain and Wilderness strongholds. Scowling,
Pilate confronted the cynically smiling Caiaphas. &ldquo;You say this
man is guilty of heinous crimes, you declare he would set himself
up as King of Judaea, but, O High Priest, you have made before
me no accusation, you have brought no witnesses to testify against
him.&rdquo; He turned to point with a sweep of his arm toward the
Galilean, standing calmly beside his guards. &ldquo;There stands the
prisoner before the tribunal. I ask you again, O High Priest, what
charges do you bring against him? Where are his accusers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caiaphas realized that the Procurator was refusing to admit
what he had assumed, at last night&rsquo;s meeting, had been a tacit
agreement, that a retrial of the prisoner would be unnecessary;
perhaps he was fearful that Rome would disapprove such a disposition
of the case. At any rate, reasoned the High Priest, further
verbal sparring would mean delay in sending the upstart
Galilean to the cross, and he wished this Jesus dead and taken
down before the beginning at sunset of the sacred Sabbath. Too,
the longer they delayed, the more likely it was that other hot-blooded
Galileans would get noise of the trial and come storming
to their leader&rsquo;s support; they might even succeed in effecting
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
the fellow&rsquo;s release. He would not, therefore, challenge Pilate further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Excellency&rdquo;&mdash;Caiaphas raised his hand and the rays of the
morning sun flashed in the gems of his rings&mdash;&ldquo;we charge that this
fellow not only sought to lead astray the people from the true worship
of our God of Israel, but that he did also forbid them to pay
tribute to Caesar, and that he did declare that he himself was
rightful King of Israel and would so establish himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate would give no consideration to the first charge, the High
Priest was sure, but, he reasoned, the Procurator could not ignore
the other two. And the soundness of his reasoning was immediately
demonstrated. Pilate turned his back upon Caiaphas and
the crowd and returned to the Praetorium, where he mounted
the tribunal and sat down. &ldquo;Are you&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed toward the
prisoner, who still, though weary, stood erect and calm&mdash;&ldquo;the King
of the Jews?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ask this of your own desire to know&rdquo;&mdash;the trace of a
smile lightened the solemn countenance&mdash;&ldquo;or has someone else
said it of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Procurator shrugged his heavy shoulders. &ldquo;Am I a Jew?&rdquo; he
asked sarcastically. &ldquo;Your own nation, your High Priest, and the
others of the Temple leadership have delivered you unto me.
What have you done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a King,&rdquo; Jesus replied calmly. &ldquo;But my Kingdom is not a
worldly kingdom; if it were, then my servants would fight against
my being delivered to these leaders of the Jews. The Kingdom
I rule is not of this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate&rsquo;s round face betrayed bafflement. &ldquo;Then you profess to be
a king, but in another realm, the world of magic, spirits...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born into this world to bear testimony to the truth,&rdquo;
Jesus answered. &ldquo;Everyone who is of the truth will understand and
acknowledge my Kingship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this man was, as Pilate had suspected all along, in no sense
a revolutionary planning Rome&rsquo;s overthrow; he was but another
of these eastern mystics, dreaming of the imponderable and intangible.
Hadn&rsquo;t Herod Antipas beheaded another such fellow
because of his slurs against Herodias, slurs undoubtedly deserved
<span class="pb" id="Page_285">285</span>
at that? The man before him, Pilate realized, was simply a religious
leader, someone whom, perhaps, Caiaphas feared as a possible
rival, who Caiaphas felt might even supplant him in the
office of High Priest. Of course, reasoned the Procurator, the fellow
might well be a little addled through too long immersion in
this utterly foolish and depraved one-god religion of Israel. &ldquo;Those
who know the truth,&rdquo; the fellow had just proclaimed, &ldquo;will recognize
me, acknowledge me as their king.&rdquo; Hah!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truth&rdquo;&mdash;Pilate shot forth his finger toward the prisoner&mdash;&ldquo;what
is truth?&rdquo; He hunched his shoulders and waved his hands, palms
up, in a gesture he had borrowed from the Jews. And without
looking toward the man of whom he had asked the question, he
stepped down from the tribunal and strode out to the High Priest
and his restive throng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have examined the prisoner as to the charges you have brought
against him,&rdquo; he announced to Caiaphas. &ldquo;I find nothing criminal
in him. He&rsquo;s a religious man, a dreamer, but he is no revolutionary.&rdquo;
He was glad to be rid of the man, though, he confessed to himself;
he was happy to wash his hands of this Jesus, Caiaphas, and
the rest of them; if he could only be freed of all Palestine, if he
could never lay eyes again upon another Jew. &ldquo;I find no fault in
the man; I shall release him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! O Excellency, no!&rdquo; Hands were waving wildly in the
air. &ldquo;No! O Pilate!&rdquo; The Procurator, scanning the throng, saw
the priests fomenting the agitation into a swell of shouted disapproval
of his verdict. Once more the High Priest stepped forward
a pace or two from the front ranks. &ldquo;The man is amazingly clever,
O Excellency,&rdquo; he declared, smiling agreeably, &ldquo;as he has just
demonstrated in thus deceiving the Procurator. But he is a criminal,
and one of the most vicious and depraved order, O sir. And
he is a revolutionary. Beginning in his native Galilee, he has deceived
and perverted the people, and by his dangerous and evil
perverting, his criminal teachings in opposition to our religion
and Rome&rsquo;s government, he has brought into Peraea and Judaea....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beginning, you say, in Galilee? Then this man is a Galilean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, O Excellency, and one of the worst of the Galilean
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
revolutionaries, one of the most dastardly clever,&rdquo; He smiled sardonically.
&ldquo;He smites with words rather than a dagger.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>... A Galilean, by great Jove! Then send him to Herod Antipas.
Let the Tetrarch dispose of this case. He assumed jurisdiction
over that fanatical Wilderness prophet and ordered him beheaded.
Well, this man, too, is a Galilean. Let Herod stand between this
persistent, obstinate High Priest and old Sejanus. Let the Tetrarch,
for once, bear the brunt of any reports sent back to Rome; this
time Sejanus may not overlook what he considers a mistake of administration
in this gods-abandoned province. If there&rsquo;s to be a
mistake, let the Tetrarch make it....</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this man,&rdquo; he said to the High Priest, &ldquo;is a subject of the
Tetrarch Herod Antipas. He should be remanded to the Tetrarch
for trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate returned quickly to the Praetorium. &ldquo;Captain of the
Guards,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;conduct this prisoner to the Tetrarch
Herod Antipas. Bear to the Tetrarch the Procurator&rsquo;s compliments
and say to him that the Procurator is sending him the King of the
Jews&rdquo;&mdash;a sneering smile for an instant pushed away the scowl on
his round face&mdash;&ldquo;a Galilean. It may be that the Tetrarch will wish
to examine the prisoner concerning the charges that have been
brought against him by the High Priest Caiaphas. At any rate,
the prisoner, being from Galilee, is a subject of the Tetrarch and
under his jurisdiction.&rdquo; He nodded curtly. &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly the guards formed about the tall prisoner and led him
from the Praetorium, down the steps into the Court of the Gentiles.
Leaving the Temple area through the Gate Shalleketh, they
crossed the bridge above the Valley of the Tyropoeon and arrived
shortly in front of the sprawling Xystus. A few moments later
they paused before the gate giving admittance to the gloomy and
forbidding ancient stone residence of the Hasmonean kings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<h2 id="c47">47</h2>
<p>Perhaps it was the thin slash of early sunlight venturing across her
bed that had aroused her; perhaps she had awakened early because
she had retired early. Pleading weariness and an aching head,
Joanna had stayed away from the Tetrarch&rsquo;s lavish dinner, the
preparation of which she had directed. She had felt certain that
the banquet, safely hidden within the old palace&rsquo;s thick walls from
the prying, sanctimonious eyes of the priests, would turn into
a drunken debauch, and the Feast of the Passover, she held
strongly, was no occasion for such frivolity.</p>
<p>The drafty old palace and the grounds about it were quiet. With
the exception of the servants, she surmised, there was likely to be
no one astir in the Tetrarch&rsquo;s household, particularly Herod Antipas
himself. No doubt he would arise late, in time to bathe and
dress for his ceremonious partaking of the Passover meal.</p>
<p>Joanna, who had come up from Tiberias with her husband
Chuza and others of the Tetrarch&rsquo;s staff, lay still and listened to
the small sounds of early morning in old Jerusalem: birds twittering
on the sill of her open window, cattle lowing in the stalls at
the Temple, the rising hum of the densely packed city&rsquo;s coming
alive.</p>
<p>So, lying quiet and keenly awake now, she heard in the court
below her window a babble of men&rsquo;s voices and the uncadenced
slap and shuffle of sandaled feet on paving stones. Quickly she
slipped from the bed and crossed her chamber. Peering out from
behind the draperies, she saw, hardly twenty paces from the palace
wall, a motley throng that numbered several Temple priests resplendently
robed, with their luxuriant beards fastidiously plaited
and oiled. One of the elegant ones, she was surprised to discover,
was the High Priest Joseph Caiaphas himself. But why, she wondered,
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
would the High Priest and his Temple aristocracy be coming
with such a nondescript mob as this into the palace courtyard?</p>
<p>She ventured to open wider the slit between the draperies and
the window frame and lean further forward. Ahead, leading the
strangely discordant procession, was a detachment of Roman soldiers,
currently assigned, no doubt, as guardsmen in the Temple
service, since they were in the vanguard of the High Priest and
others of the Temple leadership.</p>
<p>Then, in the center of the marching soldiers, she saw the manacled
prisoner. Bareheaded, he was half a head taller than his
guards; his reddish-brown hair fell straight to curl at his shoulders.
He held his head erect, but he seemed to be walking with labored
stride to keep in step with his captors; his wide shoulders sloped as
though pulled down by the weight of his long arms and the
pinioned hands; his brown homespun robe, already sweat-stained,
hung awry and loosely open at the neck.</p>
<p>Though his back was toward her, there was something vaguely
familiar about the tall one, his carriage, manner of walking, the
way he arched his back, weary though he must have been for
a long while. Then he turned his head to look over his shoulder,
and she saw the twin-spiked short beard and the curling earlocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the beard of the High Priest!&rdquo; She had almost screamed
it aloud, but she restrained herself. &ldquo;The rabbi of Nazareth!&rdquo; The
man who had healed her son of the deadly fever, who had also
cured the Centurion Cornelius&rsquo; Lucian, the good teacher whom
many believed&mdash;and she, too!&mdash;to have in those fettered hands
the veritable healing power of God Himself.</p>
<p>The procession stopped. A soldier stepped to the entrance way
and spoke to the sentry on duty there. Now the sentry was talking
with a manservant who had appeared at the portal. In another
instant the servant disappeared inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the High Priest&rsquo;s doing!&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s bringing
the Nazarene here for the Tetrarch to condemn; he&rsquo;s determined
to destroy Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped back from the window and began quickly to dress.
As she pulled on her clothes she tried desperately to evolve some
plan that might thwart the High Priest&rsquo;s evil scheme. Certainly
<span class="pb" id="Page_289">289</span>
Antipas, incredibly fearful of displeasing Caiaphas and his fellows
in the Temple leadership, would be disposed to yield to the High
Priest&rsquo;s demands, even to beheading the Galilean. Had he not
beheaded the Wilderness prophet? Had he not yielded then,
against his better judgment, to Herodias? Herod would be more
inclined to give way to Caiaphas than would the Procurator Pontius
Pilate. But if Herodias would intervene....</p>
<p>The Tetrarchess indeed! Hurriedly Joanna finished dressing and
rushed downstairs as quickly as she could without exciting undue
attention, to find the palace servant with whom the sentry
a moment ago had spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have brought the Galilean wonder worker to the Tetrarch
for trial,&rdquo; the servant revealed. &ldquo;The High Priest is charging him
with many crimes, the soldier said. They took him first before the
Procurator, but when Pilate discovered he was a Galilean, he
ordered him delivered here for trial before Tetrarch Herod. Now
they are in the judgment hall awaiting the Tetrarch&rsquo;s arrival.&rdquo; He
smiled glumly. &ldquo;Herod, I suppose, was fit to burst at being awakened
so early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next, Joanna went in search of Herodias. She found her in her
apartment; the Tetrarchess had finished her bath and now Neaera
was doing her hair. In a few words Joanna revealed that Pilate had
just sent the Galilean teacher and miracle worker to the Tetrarch
for trial and that the High Priest Caiaphas and other Sadducean
leaders were awaiting Herod&rsquo;s arrival in the judgment hall; they
planned to present charges that Jesus was guilty of crimes deserving
of death.</p>
<p>Herodias listened patiently. When Joanna finished her recital,
the Tetrarchess shrugged. &ldquo;But what do you wish me to do? How
does this Galilean&rsquo;s fate concern me? Just because he beguiled you
and Chuza into believing that he drove out the fever and healed
your son....&rdquo; She broke off with a patronizing smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He concerns you, Tetrarchess, in that the Tetrarch is greatly
concerned, though he may not suspect it. The High Priest schemed
this man&rsquo;s arrest and carried him before the Procurator, who rules
in Judaea. But Pilate, realizing that whatever judgment he might
render, whether to release the prisoner or execute him, would
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
cause a great outcry in the province and be reported to the rulers
in Rome, has cleverly sought to evade his responsibility and put
it upon the Tetrarch. Thus, the Tetrarch in trying the Galilean,
will be the one to be judged both in Israel and in Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile on the face of the crafty Herodias had vanished, and
her forehead wrinkled in sudden concern. &ldquo;But the man is a
Galilean, and Pilate in sending him before Antipas recognizes the
Tetrarch&rsquo;s authority and compliments him....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He professes to do that, but what he&rsquo;s really doing is shifting
the burden onto the Tetrarch. And when this commotion develops
into a great storm in Rome, then the Tetrarch, too late,
I&rsquo;m afraid, will know he&rsquo;s been tricked. Let him free this prisoner,
and the High Priest will inform the Emperor that the Tetrarch
has released someone who was plotting to overthrow Rome. On
the other hand, let him execute the Galilean and the report will
go by fastest ship to Rome that another prophet in the Wilderness....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Joanna, never mention that man!&rdquo; Herodias cried
out. But quickly she recovered her poise and smiled weakly. &ldquo;You
see, mere mention of that Wilderness fellow still frightens Antipas.
When he began to get reports of this Nazarene&rsquo;s appearance
before throngs in Galilee and other places, Antipas was obsessed
with the idea that this one was the Wilderness preacher returned to
life. Lately he seems to have returned to his senses, but, as you
know, he&rsquo;s a very superstitious person. And frankly, Joanna, I myself
don&rsquo;t like to be reminded of the Wilderness prophet.&rdquo; She relaxed
somewhat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about Pilate, I daresay. He probably
does wish to evade trying the Galilean. Claudia, though, would
want him to get himself involved in further difficulty; that would
make it easier for her and Longinus.&rdquo; She turned to speak to her
maid. &ldquo;Hurry, Neaera,&rdquo; she ordered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get out of here
quickly. We can finish all this later. I must see the Tetrarch before
he goes.&rdquo; Then she spoke again to the wife of Herod&rsquo;s steward.
&ldquo;Thank you, Joanna; you have done Antipas and me a great
service.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<h2 id="c48">48</h2>
<p>As the Temple guardsmen withdrew with their prisoner from the
Praetorium, Pilate beckoned to one of the Antonia soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to proceed with the trials of the revolutionaries captured
last week by Centurion Cornelius,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;If the centurion
has returned with any other captives, have them brought
in too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not returned, sir,&rdquo; the soldier said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we shall try the three we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bar Abbas and his two henchmen had already been brought up
from their cells deep under Antonia; the witnesses who would
testify against them, including several soldiers from Cornelius&rsquo; century,
were waiting in an anteroom. In the group of witnesses were
several Temple priests, elegantly robed, their beards elaborately
braided and oiled, their plump fingers weighted with rings.</p>
<p>The prisoners, shackled at wrists and ankles, were led shuffling
into the chamber to stand before the tribunal. After a week in the
blackness of the dungeon, their eyes were unaccustomed to light;
they stood blinking in the growing brightness of the chamber.
Then from an anteroom on the other side of the courtroom another
soldier escorted the witnesses to a position facing Pilate&rsquo;s
curule several paces across from the three bound men.</p>
<p>Quickly the prisoners were identified: one Bar Abbas, long
sought chieftain of a Zealot band preying upon travelers in various
sections of the province, particularly the boulder-bordered steep
ascent of the Jericho road, and two others of his fellow revolutionaries,
one Dysmas and one Gesmas, all three of Galilee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what crimes are these men charged?&rdquo; the Procurator
asked. He made no reference to their being Galileans, nor did he
<span class="pb" id="Page_292">292</span>
question his jurisdiction over them, though he had just sent
another Galilean to the Tetrarch.</p>
<p>The accusations were made. As members of a notoriously desperate
Zealot gang of revolutionaries, they had pillaged caravans,
waylaid tax collectors and robbed them of their revenues, descended
from the hills upon merchants&rsquo; pack trains and looted
them, even assailed detachments of Roman soldiers and slain
some. Then the witnesses confronted them. One of the priests,
accompanied by fellow priests of the Temple, was returning from
Caesarea when the party was set upon and robbed. He identified
the three as among his assailants; he declared he was positive the
shackled men standing there were the culprits. Then another
lavishly robed priest was called upon to give testimony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Excellency,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;it was on the Jericho road that
these men, this Bar Abbas and these other two&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to
each in turn&mdash;&ldquo;came down from the rocks and seized me. I was
bearing a large pouch of gold and silver, funds of the Temple I
was taking to be put in its coffers, when this big fellow here....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was coming <i>from</i> the Temple!&rdquo; screamed Bar Abbas, interrupting
the testimony, as he lifted his pinioned hands and shook
them so that the chains rattled loudly. &ldquo;He had stolen the money
from its coffers! But we took it from him and gave it to feed the
poor and those dispossessed by the traitorous publicans!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; commanded Pilate. &ldquo;You will have your turn to
speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next, two soldiers, one after the other, who had been coming
to Jerusalem the past week as members of the century commanded
by Centurion Cornelius, testified that the three were among the
marauders who had swept down from the rocks beside the Jericho
road to capture for a few minutes the detachment that was escorting
Tetrarch Herod Antipas and his wife and to assail the
near-by flanking columns put out by the centurion. In this assault,
the witnesses testified, several of the Roman soldiers had been
killed.</p>
<p>The three offered no evidence in rebuttal. The one called
Dysmas, who looked both grave and resigned, seemed to be studying
the pattern of the mosaic at his feet; Gesmas glared sullenly
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
at the smirking priests who had witnessed against him; and Bar
Abbas stood, as wide-legged as his chains would permit, with his
sharp black eyes fixed in defiance on the round face of his judge
and his lips above the tangle of his beard twisted in a sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I adjudge you guilty,&rdquo; Pilate said, looking in turn toward each
of the prisoners. He called to one of the soldiers on courtroom
duty. &ldquo;Go tell the commander to send me three centurions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When after a short wait the soldier returned with the three
officers and they had reported to the Procurator, Pilate faced the
convicted revolutionaries. &ldquo;I sentence each of you to the lash
and the cross. And may all such dastardly wicked enemies of Rome
so perish!&rdquo; He turned again to the tribunal attendant. &ldquo;Prepare
a titulus for each,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;and write thus: robber-assassin-revolutionary.&rdquo;
He leaned forward. &ldquo;Take them now into
the courtyard and scourge them, and then conduct them outside
the walls to the Hill of the Skull, and crucify them. Each of you
centurions will choose a quaternion to assist, and each will have
charge of the scourging and execution of one of the prisoners.
And do not dally. I wish them on the crosses quickly, so that the
Passover crowds may see what becomes of those who plot revolution
against Rome. It should have a salutary effect.&rdquo; He waved
his arm imperiously. &ldquo;Take them away!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c49">49</h2>
<p>Hardly had the Procurator climbed the stairs to his apartment and
ordered his long delayed breakfast to be brought in, when a soldier
assigned to the Praetorium reported to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, the Galilean whom you sent to the Tetrarch Herod has
been returned to you,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;The High Priest and his
Temple associates, together with a throng of excited Jews, are
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
down there awaiting your return to the Praetorium to resume trial
of the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By great Jove!&rdquo; The Procurator&rsquo;s scowl was heavy. Why had
Herod sent him back? Surely the bumbling Tetrarch hadn&rsquo;t been
clever enough to comprehend Pilate&rsquo;s scheme to evade responsibility.</p>
<p>He did not question the soldier, however, and a few moments
later he mounted the tribunal again and sat down upon the
curule. From the pavement before the Praetorium the captain of
the Temple guards and his detachment, forming a square about
the Galilean, advanced to the tribunal. Jesus, Pilate saw, was wearing
a bedraggled, purple-bordered robe. One of the soldiers was
carrying the folded brown homespun robe which the prisoner had
been wearing before.</p>
<p>Pilate, color mounting, pointed to Jesus and glared at the
officer. &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Why is he
wearing this emblem of authority? Speak up! Who is responsible
for this mockery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, sir,&rdquo; the captain hastened to declare. &ldquo;The Tetrarch
ordered one of his old robes to be placed upon the prisoner; he
said he appreciated the Procurator&rsquo;s raillery in calling the man
the King of the Jews, and he ordered him arrayed in the purple
in order to further your joking, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he examine the prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He questioned him, sir, and sought to have him work some
tricks of magic, but the prisoner made no reply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again Pilate descended from the tribunal and went out
upon the pavement before the Praetorium. At first sight of him
the mob began to raise a clamor. &ldquo;Bar Abbas!&rdquo; a man toward the
rear of the multitude screamed. &ldquo;Bar Abbas! Give us Bar Abbas!&rdquo;
Others joined in the uproar. Pilate seemed not to understand them.
&ldquo;They want to see the revolutionaries&rsquo; leader,&rdquo; he said to the soldier
who had accompanied him. &ldquo;They will see him as the condemned
men start for the Hill of the Skull. But not until I have disposed
of this Galilean. There is already too much commotion. Go into
the courtyard, and tell the centurions not to start to the execution
ground until I give the order.&rdquo; He turned back to face Caiaphas
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
and the priests and behind them the motley crowd. &ldquo;You brought
me this man and charged that he was a revolutionary, that he
sought to overthrow the rule of Rome in this province, but I
found no guilt in him, and when I sent him to the Tetrarch
Herod, ruler of Galilee, he, too, found nothing worthy of death.
So I shall discharge him. And now, disperse and let us have no
more of this tumult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! O Procurator, crucify him! Bar Abbas! Bar Abbas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crucify the King of the Jews!&rdquo; Pilate looked toward the High
Priest as he said it, as though he were jesting, but he could not
effectively conceal the scorn in his voice and on his face. &ldquo;I must
let him go free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words provoked another storm of shouted entreaties and demands.
&ldquo;Bar Abbas! Bar Abbas! Give us Bar Abbas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I have disposed of this Jesus of Galilee, you shall get
to see that revolutionary&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled glumly&mdash;&ldquo;as Bar Abbas goes
to the cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Passover release! It&rsquo;s the long-established custom, O Procurator.
Give us the Passover release!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate stared in surprise at the crowd shouting below him. Could
it be, then, as he had first suspected, that this throng hated the
Temple priests and especially Caiaphas and wanted the release of
the Galilean? But he had found Jesus not guilty and technically
had already released him. If, however, he should find him guilty
of some minor crime, such as causing a great disturbance and
commotion among the people, for example, and punish him for
that, then he might logically release him as the Passover recipient
of the Procurator&rsquo;s pardon. At the same time he would dull considerably
any report concerning this case that might find its way
to Rome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find no serious fault in this Galilean,&rdquo; he declared, as he
held up his hand to signal for silence, &ldquo;but because of his indiscretions
and his provocation of tumults and unrest and much
bickering among the people, I shall have him scourged before I
release him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He returned to the tribunal and gave the formal order for the
scourging of Jesus. Then once again he climbed the stone stairway
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
to his apartment and called for his breakfast. His food was
placed on a small table by the window, for already the morning
sun was warm and out beyond the smoldering Vale of Hinnom
dark, thickening clouds had begun to form. But the Procurator
was not permitted to relax calmly over his morning meal. The
din below not only continued, but the shoutings grew increasingly
loud. After awhile, Pilate pushed back his plate and stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll abide this no longer!&rdquo; he shouted to his orderly standing
near the doorway. &ldquo;The obstinate, cantankerous provincials!
They&rsquo;ll end this disgraceful tumult, or I&rsquo;ll have the Antonia garrison
on them with their swords!&rdquo; He caught up his toga and
started once more for the Praetorium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring out to the pavement the robber Bar Abbas and the
Galilean miracle worker,&rdquo; he commanded, when he arrived in his
tribunal chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bar Abbas! Bar Abbas! Bring forth Bar Abbas, O Procurator!&rdquo;
the multitude began to shout, as Pilate appeared on the mosaic in
front of the Praetorium. &ldquo;The Passover release! Give us Bar
Abbas!&rdquo; The Procurator, studying the vociferous throng, saw that
the cries for the release of the robber chieftain seemed to be coming
from a group of wild-eyed, fanatical-looking rough fellows
bunched behind the High Priest and his clique. The thought came
to him that they might be Zealots, even some of the escaped members
of the Bar Abbas band broken up a week before by the Centurion
Cornelius. But the supporters of the Galilean mystic, he
reasoned, would outnumber these men screaming for the release
of Bar Abbas.</p>
<p>The multitude calmed perceptibly as the scourged revolutionary
appeared on the pavement before them and then, recovered somewhat
from the shock the man&rsquo;s sad state had caused, burst into a
new clamoring for his release. Bar Abbas stared stonily ahead, as if
indifferent to the screams and yelling of the people, no doubt still
half dazed from the ordeal from which he had that moment been
delivered. Although his coarse robe had been returned to him after
the scourging and was thrown loosely about his shoulders, the milling
crowd saw at once that the leather-thonged whip had stripped
and torn the flesh of his shoulders and back; already the robe was
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
reddening into a gory, clinging covering like that which a butcher
might have worn to carry on his shoulder a freshly slaughtered
lamb.</p>
<p>But Jesus, when he was led forth from the courtyard to the pavement
before the Praetorium to stand near the robber chieftain,
made an even more pitiable figure. The purple robe he had been
wearing when he was brought back from Herod&rsquo;s judgment hall
was once again about his sagging shoulders, and it was soaked
with blood. His long hair was matted with drying blood where it
curled above his flayed and bruised shoulders, and his naked upper
arms were crisscrossed with bleeding cuts and great reddened
welts. But more shocking than the lacerations and the bleeding
flesh, the blood-soaked purple robe, the mercilessly flayed, drooping
shoulders burdened beyond human strength to endure, was the
evidence he wore upon his head of a sadism past comprehending.
Pressed down hard against his skull, so that the sharp points in
some places actually had pierced the skin of his forehead and
temples, was a circlet hastily fashioned from a long thin branch
torn from a rhamnus thorn.</p>
<p>Pilate noticed it immediately. &ldquo;Why the victor&rsquo;s wreath?&rdquo; he
asked the soldier guarding the Galilean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a victor&rsquo;s wreath,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Sir, it&rsquo;s the royal
crown of the King of the Jews.&rdquo; He ventured a smile. &ldquo;The soldiers
made it from a shrub growing near the scourging post and crowned
him with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, the crown goes well with the Tetrarch&rsquo;s purple.&rdquo; Pilate
smiled humorlessly. Then he held up his hand to command
silence. &ldquo;It must be well known to you that each year at the Feast
of the Passover it is the custom of the Procurator to release a
prisoner. Here before you are the revolutionary and murderer and
robber, one Bar Abbas, who has been sentenced to the cross, and
the prisoner brought by the High Priest, one Jesus of Galilee&rdquo;&mdash;he
paused and looking directly at the group of Temple priests,
smiled appreciatively&mdash;&ldquo;the King of the Jews....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no king!&rdquo; shouted Joseph Caiaphas, and a chorus of
angry voices supported him, &ldquo;no king except Tiberius. This man is
not our king; he is a blasphemer, an enemy of Israel&rsquo;s God; he
<span class="pb" id="Page_298">298</span>
stirs up the people; he declares himself to be king in Israel; he
calls himself the Son of God!&rdquo; He paused, as if fearful at having
uttered the ineffable name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crucify him! Crucify him!&rdquo; The mob renewed its angry demanding.
&ldquo;He claims to be the Son of God, the blasphemer!
Crucify him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Pilate paid them little heed. Turning his back upon the
High Priest and the clamoring throng on the esplanade below, he
withdrew into the Praetorium. &ldquo;Bring him inside,&rdquo; he said, motioning
with his head as he looked back. And then he spoke to the
soldier guarding Bar Abbas. &ldquo;And remove that one from the sight
of the multitude. But presently I shall call for him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Procurator had hardly mounted the tribunal when a soldier
entered the chamber from the courtyard and handed a tablet to
one of the attendants. The two whispered, heads together, for a
moment. Then the attendant strode quickly to the tribunal, saluted,
and presented Pilate the wax tablet. &ldquo;A message, sir, from the
Procurator&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The messenger reported it was
urgent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily Pilate scanned the tablet. He scowled, then beckoned
to the man. &ldquo;Fetch me the soldier who brought this tablet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment the soldier was standing stiffly before the
tribunal. &ldquo;Soldier,&rdquo; Pilate inquired, &ldquo;did you bring this message
from the hand of the Lady Claudia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It was handed to me in the courtyard
over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Centurion Longinus, sir; he had just come, I understood,
from the Palace of the Herods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quick frown darkened the Procurator&rsquo;s countenance. &ldquo;And
where is the Centurion Longinus now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I think he went up to his apartment in the fortress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate nodded and waved the man aside; his face was heavy
as once again he read his wife&rsquo;s message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Hear me, Pilate</i>:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Take no responsibility for that righteous man&rsquo;s blood, for in
the night I had a frightful dream concerning him.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>What on earth, he wondered, could Claudia have dreamed about
this Galilean fanatic? And how did she know that the man had
been brought before the Procurator&rsquo;s tribunal? Yes, and by all the
gods, why had the message come from Longinus, and why, moreover,
had Longinus not delivered it himself?</p>
<p>Still frowning, Pilate turned once again to question the prisoner
standing calmly before the tribunal, his face streaked with drying
sweat and blood, his robe turned deep crimson from the whip&rsquo;s
fearful wounds, his matted hair still crowned with the circlet of
thorns. &ldquo;They say you claim to be the son of their god,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;What do they mean? Tell me, where <i>do</i> you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus appeared lost in introspection. If he heard the Procurator&rsquo;s
question, he ignored it. An infinite sadness seemed to possess him.</p>
<p>But Pilate, still scowling, perhaps upset further because of his
wife&rsquo;s message and the manner in which it had been brought to
him, revealed his impatience. &ldquo;Will you answer me?&rdquo; he asked
testily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that I have the power either to release
you or to condemn you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calmly, looking the Procurator in the eyes and with no tone
of rancor, Jesus replied. &ldquo;You would have no power over me were
it not granted you from above. Therefore, he who delivered me
to you&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed toward the esplanade where the High Priest
and his cohorts awaited&mdash;&ldquo;has a greater guilt than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again the Procurator stepped down from the tribunal and
strode out to the pavement in front of the Praetorium. &ldquo;Bring
forth the prisoner,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;And have Bar Abbas brought
to me, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall release to you a Passover prisoner,&rdquo; he announced to
the multitude when the two scourged prisoners stood before him.
&ldquo;Here stand a robber and assassin&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed toward Bar
Abbas&mdash;&ldquo;and&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled grimly as he waved his hand toward the
Galilean&mdash;&ldquo;your King of the Jews. Which shall I release?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bar Abbas! Bar Abbas!&rdquo; the people howled, and Pilate could
see the priests exhorting them to shout their demands. &ldquo;Release
Bar Abbas! Bar Abbas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what shall I do with the King of the Jews?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<p>&ldquo;Crucify him! Crucify him!&rdquo; they stormed. &ldquo;Release unto us
Bar Abbas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not our king!&rdquo; shouted Caiaphas. &ldquo;We have no king but
Caesar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grudgingly, Pilate nodded to the robber chief&rsquo;s guards. &ldquo;Release
him.&rdquo; The Procurator had lost. He had been sure the Galilean&rsquo;s
followers would outnumber the vociferous Zealots. But Caiaphas
had been the better schemer.</p>
<p>Quickly the soldiers freed the hulking Bar Abbas, and in another
moment he disappeared with a tumultuously happy group of his
supporters, probably members of his own band, in the mass of
people thronging the Court of the Gentiles. But the High Priest
and his hirelings kept their places on the pavement before the
Praetorium. Now the Procurator, pointing toward the Galilean,
spoke to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then shall I do with the King of the Jews?&rdquo; His tone
was sarcastic. &ldquo;<i>I</i> find no fault in him. I shall release him, just as
I have already released your robber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Crucify him! He is not our king! He is a blasphemer
who would destroy us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crucify your king?&rdquo; A cold smile lifted the corners of the
Procurator&rsquo;s heavy lips. &ldquo;Crucify the King of the Jews?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no king, O Procurator,&rdquo; Caiaphas declared evenly,
when he had lifted his hands to still the clamor, &ldquo;no king but
Caesar. And if you are a friend of Caesar, O Excellency, you will
rid us of this one who not only seeks to destroy our religion but
also to set himself upon the restored throne of King David. Should
word get to Tiberius or Sejanus in Rome....&rdquo; The High Priest
shrugged and smiled suggestively.</p>
<p>Word would certainly reach the capital. And the story would
be of the High Priest&rsquo;s coloring. The Procurator Pontius Pilate,
despite repeated warning and ample testimony establishing the
guilt of the accused, it would be told, had released a dangerously
clever revolutionary intent upon restoring the ancient kingdom of
the Jews in Palestine with himself as king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he declares that his kingdom is not of this world,&rdquo; Pilate
<span class="pb" id="Page_301">301</span>
tried to protest. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s nothing but a harmless babbler, a religious
fanatic whom too much reasoning has driven mad....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he would have you think, O Procurator. The man is cunning,
amazingly clever, captivating.&rdquo; Caiaphas smiled indulgently.
&ldquo;Has he not already deceived even the wise and discerning Procurator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The High Priest Joseph Caiaphas had won. Already too many
reports of the conduct of the Procurator&rsquo;s office had gone to
Rome; one more might be sufficient to arouse the wrath of the
Prefect Sejanus. Nevertheless, since the High Priest had forced
the verdict, the responsibility would rest on him. He clapped his
hands and when a servant came running, called for a basin of water.
A moment later, as the servant held the basin before him, the
Procurator plunged his hands into the water and rubbed them together
vigorously. &ldquo;Let the people heed,&rdquo; he said loudly and with
ostentation, &ldquo;that I wash my hands of the blood of this man. I
am guiltless. His blood is not upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, O Procurator&rdquo;&mdash;the High Priest&rsquo;s smile was scornful,
his tone sneeringly derisive&mdash;&ldquo;let his blood be upon us, yea, and
our children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take him, and crucify him.&rdquo; Pilate glanced toward the
prisoner, standing tall and calm and regal in the blood-drenched
discarded purple. But when their eyes met, Pilate&rsquo;s shifted in that
same instant to the mosaic at the Galilean&rsquo;s feet, so that momentarily
the judge&rsquo;s head was bowed to the prisoner. Then, in a voice
that was scarcely more than a whisper, Pilate spoke to the guard
who held the fetter binding Jesus&rsquo; wrists. &ldquo;Lead him into the
courtyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were going out he summoned an attendant. &ldquo;Fetch
a tablet that I may prepare the titulus.&rdquo; His eyes fell upon the
wax tablet that his wife had sent him. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This one
will suffice. There&rsquo;s space enough on it for what I have in mind.&rdquo;
The soldier picked up the tablet with the attached stylus. &ldquo;Write
this,&rdquo; Pilate commanded, &ldquo;and when you have written it, take the
tablet into the courtyard and have the words inscribed on the
headboard in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.&rdquo; He paused, reflecting.
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
&ldquo;Write what I say: <i>This is Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the
Jews</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph Caiaphas had heard. &ldquo;No, O Procurator! Write that he
says he is King of the Jews!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pontius Pilate stared in stony silence at the furious High Priest.
&ldquo;What I have written,&rdquo; he said after a moment, &ldquo;I have written.&rdquo;
He turned to the soldier. &ldquo;Go prepare the titulus board.&rdquo; Then,
without a glance toward the High Priest and his group, he returned
to the Praetorium and mounted the tribunal. Only the few
soldiers in attendance remained in the vaulted great chamber.
Pilate sat down upon the curule; his eyes, unseeing, were fixed on
the pattern of the mosaic at the foot of the tribunal steps.</p>
<p><i>... Great Rome&rsquo;s vaunted justice. But must not justice yield
sometimes to expediency, the expediency of the greater good for
the greater number? Will not his death end a developing tumult
in Palestine that might have brought even bloodshed and death
for many Jews and perhaps even Roman soldiers? And now no
report will go to Sejanus from Joseph Caiaphas.</i></p>
<p><i>... The Galilean. A dreamer, a devotee of the Jewish religion,
a visionary ... a righteous man, Claudia said. &ldquo;Take no responsibility
for that righteous man&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo; Claudia&rsquo;s dream, bah. Superstition,
astrology maybe, foolishness. Calpurnia had a dream,
and Caesar laughed at her warning. Caesar laughed, and Caesar
died.</i></p>
<p><i>... But no report will go to Rome of the Procurator&rsquo;s releasing
a dangerous revolutionary who was planning to establish himself
on the restored throne of ancient Israel. Joseph Caiaphas has been
silenced....</i></p>
<p>Suddenly a cold, numbing fear clutched Pontius Pilate. &ldquo;By
great Jove!&rdquo; But he had not exclaimed aloud. No report would
go to Rome from the High Priest, no fawning spies would tell
how the Procurator had freed a cunning revolutionary, but Claudia
had warned him not to judge the Galilean. Could his wife, by all
the gods, be a secret follower of this mystic? Didn&rsquo;t many high-placed
women of Rome become devotees of this strange Jewish
one-god religion? Could the Emperor&rsquo;s stepdaughter, by great
Jove, have become, of all persons, interested in religion, in any
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
religion? Could Claudia really feel strongly about this Nazarene
fellow?</p>
<p><i>... And Longinus had fetched her message. Longinus, yes, by
all the gods....</i></p>
<p>The soldier who had led Jesus forth from the pavement into
the courtyard had returned to the Praetorium. &ldquo;Sir, the titulus
board is complete. They are ready to proceed with the crucifixions,
except....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then start at once with the three prisoners to the Hill of the
Skull.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;Except? What were you going to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have assigned no centurion, sir, to have charge of the
crucifixion of this fellow whom you have just condemned. Do
you wish Porcius, who was to have crucified Bar Abbas....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then, in a flash came an idea. Pilate maintained a sternly
impassive countenance, but inwardly he exulted in the suddenly
revealed manner of solving his dilemma. Now <i>no one</i> would be
sending stories to Rome, for certainly nobody would be foolish
enough to reveal to Sejanus the execution of an innocent Jew if
<i>he himself</i> had participated with the Procurator in that Jew&rsquo;s
crucifixion. &ldquo;I wish Porcius for another duty today.&rdquo; He pointed
upward. &ldquo;Go at once to the apartment of the Centurion Longinus
and inform him that the Procurator assigns him to take charge
of the quaternion and orders him to proceed immediately with
the crucifixion of the Galilean.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c50">50</h2>
<p>Beside a cluster of gnarled olive trees along the Bethany road
Centurion Cornelius halted his weary cavalcade. They had attained
the summit of the Mount of Olives. Steady climbing from
the Jericho plain had lathered the laboring horses, and the dust-grimed
faces of the men were streaked with perspiration. Since the
<span class="pb" id="Page_304">304</span>
passing of midday the heat had grown increasingly oppressive; now,
as they approached Jerusalem in the eerie half-darkness, it weighed
upon them like a heavy blanket.</p>
<p>The dark cloud over the city that hardly two hours ago they had
seen from the narrow defile between the boulders had grown to
envelop them, and as they came over the rise and looked across
toward the walled density of flat-roofed stone structures, they
could scarcely make out the usually dominating mass of the
Temple. Ordinarily on an early afternoon in April the sun would
have been reflected brilliantly in the gold plates of the Temple&rsquo;s
roof, but today it was barely able to penetrate the overcast. In the
strangely thickening gloom the resplendent plates had taken on
a dull coating of bilious green. Faintly discernible to the right
were the darker masses of the Fortress Antonia towers upthrust in
the cloaking shadows; but westward, beyond Antonia, the great
Palace of the Herods and the other splendid abodes of the privileged
were completely shrouded; Mount Zion and the Ophel
shared equally in oblivion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Centurion?&rdquo; Decius shook his head perplexedly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been out here a long time, but I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like
it. This strange darkness, this stillness, and the peculiar blue-green
cast. Centurion, this isn&rsquo;t just another storm coming up,
another thunderstorm following excessive heat. It&rsquo;s got a queer,
ghastly look, as if the gods might be angry ...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gods, Decius?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier laughed uneasily. &ldquo;I use the term broadly, for want
of one more accurate.&rdquo; He waved an arm in the direction of the
darkened city. &ldquo;But it does have a sort of supernatural look, doesn&rsquo;t
it, Centurion?&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;though of course I have little belief
in the supernatural.&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;How do you explain it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does have a strange, unearthly look,&rdquo; Cornelius agreed. &ldquo;But
I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s a manifestation of the gods&rsquo; anger, though I&rsquo;ve
never seen one before like this. Could it be a heavy mass of sand
borne in from the desert? If that&rsquo;s it, then maybe the sun shining
through the concentration of sand accounts for this strange greenish
color.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably it,&rdquo; Decius agreed. &ldquo;But then, where is the
wind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be the lull before the wind. This unseasonable heat is
bound to bring on a storm. Look!&rdquo; He pointed. &ldquo;The sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>High above the city, beyond its southern wall and past the
ever smoldering refuse heaps in the Vale of Hinnom, the sun
rode like a pale copper disk behind a thinning portion of the veiling
cloud. In the same instant its rays found a rift in the mantle
covering the city and shot a pinpoint of light to bathe in sudden
brilliance a small eminence just beyond and slightly to the right of
the Fortress Antonia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the gods! Bar Abbas and the two henchmen we captured
last week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the summit of the little hill stood three crosses, and
stretched upon each cross was the body of a man. A staring throng
of spectators stood scattered about below.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the rift in the covering cloud was healed; darkness
swallowed the burdened crosses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor devils,&rdquo; Cornelius said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an assignment I&rsquo;m glad I
didn&rsquo;t get. Being late returning may have saved me.&rdquo; He looked
up again toward the lowering sky. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;d better be getting on
to Antonia. This storm may break at any moment, and when it
does, I don&rsquo;t want to be in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly the cavalcade moved down the slope toward the Garden
of Gethsemane and the Brook Kidron beyond. Entering the walled
city by Dung Gate, it went through Ophel and ascended the slope
westward to move along the lower level of Mount Zion and cross
the bridge spanning the Tyropoeon Valley. At the eastern end of
the bridge the procession turned northward and marched along the
way paralleling the Temple&rsquo;s wall to the entrance gate of the Antonia.</p>
<p>When Cornelius had dismissed his men, he went up at once
to his apartment in the officers&rsquo; quarters on the south side of the
fortress. He had been looking forward eagerly to a refreshing bath
and a short nap before dressing in fresh clothing for the evening
meal. But as he was about to enter his quarters he encountered
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
a centurion coming into the corridor from the apartment next to
his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Hercules, Cornelius!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Porcius!&rdquo; He clapped a hand on the other&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know you were quartered here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come since you left, Cornelius. I heard you were out pursuing
a gang of those Zealots. Did you overtake any of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and killed several. But we didn&rsquo;t capture any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning they crucified two of the ones you captured
last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three, you mean, don&rsquo;t you? Bar Abbas and two of his company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Pilate released Bar Abbas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Released him? Bar Abbas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, released him. It&rsquo;s amazing, isn&rsquo;t it? But the mob demanded
his release as the Passover prisoner&mdash;you know, don&rsquo;t you, that the
Procurator each year, in accordance with tradition, releases one
prisoner at Passover time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius nodded. &ldquo;But weren&rsquo;t there three men crucified?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I was supposed to have had charge of the crucifixion of
Bar Abbas. Pilate had already condemned him to the cross when
the demand for his release was made. So he released him, and I
was relieved of a most unpleasant task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were fortunate, Porcius. But if three men were crucified,
who was the third? I didn&rsquo;t know another revolutionary had been
captured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was no revolutionary, Cornelius. Pilate knew he wasn&rsquo;t
and wanted to free him. But the High Priest insisted that the fellow
was a troublemaker who planned to attempt to set himself up
as King of Israel. So, rather than run the risk of having the Temple
leaders report him to Rome as protector of the Emperor&rsquo;s enemies,
Pilate yielded and sent the fellow to the cross. And luckily for me,
he assigned Centurion Longinus the task of conducting the man&rsquo;s
execution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longinus! By all the gods, Porcius, who was the fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Galilean. A religious fanatic, I judged him to be, but entirely
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
harmless. His name, if I recall it correctly, was Jesus, I think,
one Jesus from a place in Galilee called Nazareth, they said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus! Oh, by all the gods, when....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you know the man, Centurion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did they lead him to the Hill of the Skull?&rdquo; Cornelius
ignored the centurion&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;How long...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in mid-morning. He&rsquo;s been on the cross for several hours
now. And he was unmercifully scourged before they started with
him to the crucifixion ground.&rdquo; He stared at his companion&rsquo;s suddenly
ashen face. &ldquo;But, Cornelius, why...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus! Oh, great Jove!&rdquo; Anger, utter amazement and pain were
written in swift succession on his still sweating, dust-covered face.
&ldquo;O God of Israel! O his God! O <i>my</i> God, Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, he raced along the corridor toward the steps that a
moment ago he had ascended, stone stairs that went down to the
ground-floor open area just inside the great western entrance to the
fortress.</p>
<h2 id="c51">51</h2>
<p>Cornelius had reached the gate in the north wall when the storm
broke with sudden fury. He darted beneath the flimsy awning of a
fish stall to wait out the blast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me help,&rdquo; he said to the frantic shopkeeper as he
caught a side of the filthy cloth with which the squat Jew was trying
desperately to cover his malodorous fish to protect them from
the dust and powdered dung swirling along the cobblestones.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky your market has the protection of the wall, or everything
would be blown away. This is one of the worst storms I&rsquo;ve
ever.... By all the gods!&rdquo; The ground had begun to tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An earthquake!&rdquo; the shopkeeper shouted. &ldquo;Wind and torrents
of rain, and now the earth shakes!&rdquo; His eyes were round and
<span class="pb" id="Page_308">308</span>
frightened. But in another moment the tremors subsided, and the
man regained his calm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised, soldier,&rdquo; he observed,
lifting his hands, palms up, and shaking his head solemnly. &ldquo;And
it makes no difference, I&rsquo;m thinking, that my stall sits in the lee
of the great wall. By the beard of the High Priest, it, too, will be
leveled to the ground!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Hasn&rsquo;t this wall survived many an earthquake
before this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, soldier. But we&rsquo;ve never had anything like that before.&rdquo;
He indicated with a quick nod of his head the hill beyond
the gate&rsquo;s square. &ldquo;Never <i>him</i> on a cross.&rdquo; He looked the centurion
in the eyes, and Cornelius fancied he saw a sudden hostility.
&ldquo;Soldier, have you been up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve just come from the Fortress Antonia, and only an hour
ago I arrived in Jerusalem. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that one up there, soldier, on the middle cross.&rdquo; He
pointed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that rabbi from Galilee. Your Pilate tried him this
morning and sent him to the cross, and unjustly, too, it&rsquo;s my
opinion. And I heard it said that the Galilean told how he would
cause the Temple to be destroyed and in three days raise it up
again.&rdquo; He dabbed a greasy forefinger against the centurion&rsquo;s
soiled toga. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m of the opinion, soldier, he&rsquo;s got the power
to do it. Didn&rsquo;t he raise that fellow over at Bethany from the dead?
This storm and this earthquake&rdquo;&mdash;he paused and on his countenance
was an expression of understanding suddenly gained&mdash;&ldquo;soldier,
maybe he&rsquo;s doing it now! Nor could I blame him.&rdquo; He shook
his head slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to be in Pilate&rsquo;s sandals, or those soldiers&rsquo;
up there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost as quickly as it had burst upon them, the storm was
ended. The rain ceased with the blowing away of the clouds, the
winds quieted, and the great blazing disk of the sun, still high in
the sky toward the Great Sea, shone down bright and searing. The
shopkeeper rolled back the grimy cloth, crumpled it into a heap,
and with it dabbed lightly at several fish it had failed to protect;
then he hurled it into a corner and turned to wait upon pilgrims
in the vanguard of a procession Cornelius saw coming down the
slope of the Hill of the Skull.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Galilean, is he...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; the man answered before the fish merchant could
complete his question. &ldquo;He died just as the storm broke. This
fish&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed&mdash;&ldquo;where was it caught?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No earlier than the day before yesterday, and fetched by fast
cart from the Sea of Galilee. Good, fresh carp, perches, bream.&rdquo;
With grimy fingers he poked at now one and now another of
his offerings. &ldquo;The finest fish in Jerusalem, and the most weight
for your money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius stepped away from the stall into the warmth of the
freshly cleansed air. As he walked quickly along the road he could
now see plainly revealed the three crosses and their inert, mutilated
burdens. The pause in the fish market during the raging of the
storm had given him time to catch his breath after racing over
the cobblestones from the square in front of Antonia.</p>
<p>But why had he come on the run to the Hill of the Skull? Why
had he come at all? Porcius had said that Jesus had already been
nailed to the cross for several hours. Had the centurion hoped in
some mysterious manner to save the Galilean, to get him down
from the cross and revive him? Had he thought he might countermand
Pilate&rsquo;s judgment and sentence?</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t thought. He had acted on his emotions. He had
wanted to see Jesus, to protest to Longinus, to scream out his denunciation
of everyone who&rsquo;d had a hand in this abominable act.
He hadn&rsquo;t reasoned any course of action. He had only come as
fast as he could to the place of horrors, his whole being seething
with resentment and anger and a terrible bitterness.</p>
<p>And now Jesus was dead. The good man who had done no man
ill, who had done countless men good, who had restored Lucian,
and Chuza&rsquo;s son. Or had he really?</p>
<p>Would he be up there now, perhaps already dead on a Roman
cross, if he had had the power to heal Chuza&rsquo;s little boy, if he had
been able by his own mighty will to rid Lucian of the fever that
was consuming him? Would he?</p>
<p>Longinus had been right. Those &ldquo;miracles&rdquo; had been only remarkable
coincidences. The Galilean wonder worker, the good
man, the son of the Jews&rsquo; one god&mdash;Cornelius ventured to raise
<span class="pb" id="Page_310">310</span>
his head from the ascending path and look upward toward the
central cross&mdash;was hanging spiked to a crossbeam, crumpled and
lifeless, as dead, or soon to be, as those two revolutionaries
who hung there with him. And Longinus, though unhappy that
Pilate had required him to crucify an innocent man, would remind
him that all along he had been right in denying that Jesus
of Galilee had been anything more than a good man.</p>
<p>He found Longinus seated not far from the crosses on a low
stone outcropping. His head was bent forward, cradled in his hands,
and his eyes were fastened to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been expecting you, Cornelius,&rdquo; he said, looking up as his
friend spoke. &ldquo;I knew you would be coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t get into Jerusalem until a short time before the
storm. As soon as I heard at Antonia, I came running; I was at
the gate down there when the storm struck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would come.&rdquo; He shook his head slowly; his eyes
were fixed, unseeing. &ldquo;And I deserve everything you&rsquo;re going to
say.&rdquo; He lifted his face, and Cornelius saw on it fear and sorrow
and a great revulsion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m undone, my friend.&rdquo; He arose slowly
to his feet, and his eyes, for an instant before he looked away,
encompassed the crosses behind Cornelius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Longinus, you didn&rsquo;t ... it was Pilate....&rdquo; He reached
out to put his hand on his comrade&rsquo;s arm, but Longinus drew
back, hand raised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Cornelius, Pilate condemned him, but I <i>killed</i> him! I,
this hand. Look!&rdquo; He held it before him and turned it slowly.
&ldquo;His blood! His innocent blood! I tortured to his slow death an
innocent man, a good man, Cornelius, a perfect man, yes, and by
all the gods, even more than a perfect man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d thought that he was more, that perhaps he possessed powers
no man could have, I&rsquo;d hoped so; I&rsquo;d hoped that he had called
upon a supernatural power to heal Lucian. But would a god, would
the son of <i>the God</i>, if there is one, my friend&rdquo;&mdash;Cornelius&rsquo; countenance
was darkly pained&mdash;&ldquo;allow himself to be put to death, to
accept the tortured death of the cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that my saying it sounds strange, Cornelius, but ever
since this morning I&rsquo;ve had the feeling that he was <i>allowing</i> himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
to be crucified and that at any moment, if he had wished, he
could have destroyed us all. Yet in the midst of his agonies, while
we were spiking him to the crossbeam, he prayed to his god to forgive
us. To forgive us, Centurion!&rdquo; He shook his head sadly. &ldquo;To
forgive <i>me</i>. But I killed him. By all the gods, let me show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked over to the foot of the center cross. The body of
Jesus, naked except for a bloody loincloth, hung out from the
upright at a grotesque angle, held by heavy spikes through the
palms of the hands and supported by a narrow wedge between the
legs. The head had slumped forward so that the twin points of his
short beard splayed out across his chest. Other large spikes through
his purpling feet held them to the upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; Longinus pointed to a gaping wound from which blood
and body fluid still dripped slowly. Blood had gushed forth when
the wound was made, for below it the tortured flesh was wide
streaked and the loincloth was gore-soaked; his blood had run down
the length of one leg, and even as Cornelius stared, a crimson
bead swelled at the end of the great toe and dropped to the bloodstained
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why this wound?&rdquo; Cornelius asked. &ldquo;Did you...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was my lance that did it. He must have been already
dead, but I didn&rsquo;t know. And I couldn&rsquo;t bear for him to have to
endure any more agony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did it in mercy, Longinus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I killed him, Cornelius. He&rsquo;s dead, and I can never
have his forgiveness. And I&rsquo;m soiled, ruined, undone. I can never
cleanse myself&rdquo;&mdash;he studied his hands&mdash;&ldquo;of this man&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
He lifted his eyes to stare at his friend. &ldquo;Strange, Cornelius, but
... well you know what I&rsquo;ve always thought of the gods, Roman,
Greek, Jewish, any of them, and of the survival of the spirit or
whatever you want to call it. And you know what I thought of&rdquo;&mdash;he
gazed a moment at the dead man stiffening above them&mdash;&ldquo;him.... Well
today I&rsquo;ve been with him for several hours, <i>long</i>,
terrible hours of torture for him, and for me, too.&rdquo; He paused,
trying painfully to choose his words. &ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t know, Cornelius;
I&rsquo;m confused, my smug assurance is gone. I&rsquo;m not sure any
<span class="pb" id="Page_312">312</span>
more. But he&rdquo;&mdash;he looked up again&mdash;&ldquo;by all the gods, Cornelius,
he was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think now he may have been...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there are any gods, Cornelius&rdquo;&mdash;he stared into the blood-drained
face of the Galilean, and his voice was infinitely sad&mdash;&ldquo;if
there exists any being like the one your old Greek tutor spoke of, a
good, all-wise, all-powerful one god, then this man must have
been the son of that god.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c52">52</h2>
<p>As soon as Longinus left the palace with her message, Claudia
went back to bed in the hope of finding relaxing sleep after the
terrifying dream. But sleep would not come; she was almost afraid
to close her eyes for fear the nightmare would return. And even as
she lay sleepless, staring wide-eyed at the high ceiling of her bed-chamber,
she began to envision a pair of disembodied blood-red
hands feeling their way stealthily around and across the intricate
plastered figures and medallions of its surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tullia, it&rsquo;s no use trying any longer,&rdquo; she called to her maid, as
she swung her feet around to stand up. &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t seem to shake
off the dream. Maybe if I dress and busy myself at something, I&rsquo;ll
think no more of it. Thank the gods, though, I sent the Procurator
that warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as the morning hours went by the dream did not go away;
it persisted in all its horrible detail in the forefront of her consciousness,
and the harder she tried to dispel it, the more determinedly
it stayed with her. &ldquo;Why, by the Great Mother, little
one, am I so disturbed by a dream?&rdquo; she at length demanded of
her maid. &ldquo;I put no faith in dreams. I must have had thousands,
and not one has ever before bothered me. I know they&rsquo;re nothing
but rearrangements, often fanciful and sometimes, like this one,
<span class="pb" id="Page_313">313</span>
frightening, of things that have happened to us, people we&rsquo;ve
seen, places we&rsquo;ve visited. You can always explain them. Even
this one I understand. You came in late from Bethany with the
fearful news of the Galilean&rsquo;s arrest and the High Priest&rsquo;s plotting
to have Pilate condemn him. Then soon afterward I went to
sleep and dreamed about it. It&rsquo;s simple enough to understand....&rdquo;
She paused, silent in thought. &ldquo;Or is it?&rdquo; she asked softly.
&ldquo;Are people ever warned in dreams? Is there really some power...?&rdquo;
The question was unfinished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it, Mistress. Our ancient scriptures tell of many
instances in which God spoke to His prophets in visions, which
must have been dreams or the like.&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the
story of Julius Caesar&rsquo;s wife, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Claudia&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;But if your god wished to save
the Galilean&rsquo;s life, why didn&rsquo;t he let Pilate have the dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tullia shook her head thoughtfully. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say. I can&rsquo;t fathom
the mind of God, Mistress.&rdquo; A suggestion of a smile crossed her
face. &ldquo;Maybe He thought you might have more influence on the
Procurator than He Himself could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia smiled. &ldquo;Certainly I&rsquo;m more real to Pilate&mdash;and threatening,
no doubt&mdash;than your Yahweh.&rdquo; With a quick lifting of her
shoulder, she changed her tone. &ldquo;But why talk of it further? I&rsquo;m
sure my message warned him sufficiently. And I want to forget
the dream and the Galilean. This terrific heat is exhausting enough.
Still, I do wonder....&rdquo; She scowled and said no more.</p>
<p>The heat grew more intolerable. Longinus did not return, nor
did any news come from Antonia. Midday passed, and as she had
done the day before, Claudia retreated into the garden and sat on
the stone bench before the spouting fountain. But today, unlike
yesterday, there were no white puffs of clouds. Instead, from noon
on, a thick overcast began to settle upon Jerusalem, so that inside
the palace servants lighted lamps, which added, it seemed to
Claudia, to the oppressiveness. As she sat staring introspectively
at the spray of water, the heat, despite the covering of clouds
screening off the sun&rsquo;s rays, seemed to be mounting as the skies
darkened; in the thickening gloom the air grew still; yesterday&rsquo;s
singing, twittering birds had taken cover under the heavy, drooping
<span class="pb" id="Page_314">314</span>
foliage, and all nature seemed silently expectant of a coming
upheaval. But maybe, thought Claudia, the impending storm will
not descend; maybe the winds, like yesterday, will spring up and
blow the clouds away and bring welcome relief from this oppressive
heat.</p>
<p>It was during this foreboding lull, some two hours past midday,
that a sedan chair entered the palace grounds, and when the
bearers set it down at the doorway, the Tetrarchess of Galilee and
Peraea emerged and was admitted to the sumptuous edifice. A
moment later, with much bowing and murmured directing, servants
conducted her to the wife of the Procurator. But the two
had done little more than exchange greetings and sit down together
when the winds did come, and with a suddenness and
severity that sent them scurrying for the protection of the palace.
This time the clouds were not immediately blown away; crash
after crash of lightning sundered them, and for a few wild moments
they poured a deluge upon the steaming, crowded capital
of ancient Israel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claudia, I know you wonder why I have come,&rdquo; Herodias said,
when they were settled in one of the inner chambers into which
little of the noise of the storm penetrated. &ldquo;But soon the Feast of
the Passover will be ended, and we will be going back to our posts;
I&rsquo;m sure you, at any rate, are unwilling to consider Caesarea home.
So we may have little further opportunity to talk together alone,
Herod&rsquo;s engaged at the palace, and Pilate, I presume, will be busy
at Antonia.&rdquo; Claudia nodded. &ldquo;Yes. Well, you remember once
in Rome when you came over to see me and we were talking about
Antipas and Longinus, and you wondered why I was interested in
the Tetrarch....&rdquo; Herodias paused, and Claudia, smiling,
nodded again. &ldquo;You may recall, too, I told you that I was interested
in what the Tetrarch could become, in the position he might
attain, rather than in Antipas as a man....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I recall. You said he might become a king like his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. Some day he might, I believe I said, with my conniving.&rdquo;
She leaned forward and looked Claudia directly in the eyes. &ldquo;The
time has come,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;for us to begin our determined
conniving.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_315">315</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Our?</i>&rdquo; Claudia queried, her tone intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. What I&rsquo;m scheming will concern you, and Longinus, as
much as it will Antipas and me.&rdquo; Her brow suddenly furrowed.
&ldquo;You still feel the same way about the centurion, don&rsquo;t you, as
you did when you left Rome to come out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know, Claudia, you must be careful, must guard your
tongue. But you needn&rsquo;t worry about my making indiscreet remarks,
you know.&rdquo; She shrugged. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thus far, have I? And
I&rsquo;ve known all along. And now&rdquo;&mdash;she did not wait for Claudia to
answer her question&mdash;&ldquo;the time has come for us to strike out for
what both of us want. Soon Longinus will be going back to Rome,
and more than likely this time he&rsquo;ll have much to tell the Prefect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Herodias....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tetrarchess laughed and shrugged. &ldquo;Oh, nobody has told
me anything,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I do have eyes and ears and an ability
to put things together. I know that Senator Piso and Sejanus are
more than friends; they&rsquo;re bound to be business partners, for
Sejanus, you may be sure, has his fingers in any enterprise that has
been operating with considerable success. I know that Longinus
has had unusual freedom for a centurion presumably on active
duty and that he has made trips back to Rome, to Antioch, and to
many another place that no centurion ordinarily would be called
on to visit in the course of duty. And you told me, remember,
that he was being sent out to Palestine on a special mission.&rdquo; She
paused, and when Claudia made no comment, she smiled and gestured
with outflung hands. &ldquo;Well, it makes little difference
whether he was sent out to watch Pilate or not, and maybe Antipas
and me ...&rdquo; she paused, grinning, &ldquo;and possibly even you,
Claudia. He&rsquo;ll probably be called back to Rome soon to make
some sort of report, even about the operation of the Senator&rsquo;s
glassworks....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how would that affect you and Antipas, and Pilate ...
and maybe me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longinus might be called back to Rome to report on Pilate&rsquo;s
... well, shortcomings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even then I fail to understand how....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">316</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the way I envision what might easily happen should he
be ordered to Rome,&rdquo; Herodias interrupted. &ldquo;Longinus certainly
must have strong influence with Sejanus, because he&rsquo;s Senator
Piso&rsquo;s son, for one thing. Should he point out, and with emphasis,
Pilate&rsquo;s failures as an administrator&mdash;and certainly he&rsquo;d have little
trouble supporting his charge&mdash;he might very likely cause the Prefect
to dismiss Pilate as Procurator or move him to another province.
And with Pilate disgraced, surely you would be permitted
to divorce him.&rdquo; She smiled and airily lifted her hands. &ldquo;Then, my
dear, you could marry Longinus and return to Rome to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so. But even then how would that affect you and
Antipas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herodias leaned toward her hostess, her expression intent. &ldquo;Suppose
Pilate is dismissed, transferred, even, by the gods, beheaded....&rdquo;
Her eyes narrowed. &ldquo;That would cause you no
grief, would it?&rdquo; But she did not pause for Claudia&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;Then Sejanus, regardless of Pilate&rsquo;s fate, might extend Antipas&rsquo;
realm to include Judaea, don&rsquo;t you see, and elevate him to kingship.
And I&rdquo;&mdash;she sat back and smiled felinely&mdash;&ldquo;would be queen.&rdquo;
Quickly the smile vanished. &ldquo;And I shall never be content,
Claudia, until I&rsquo;m a queen. Why, soon as Tetrarchess I&rsquo;ll have
no higher station than little Salome.&rdquo; She paused, her expression
suddenly questioning. &ldquo;Did you know that she is marrying Herod
Philip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Her father?</i>&rdquo; Claudia exclaimed, aghast. &ldquo;By all the gods,
surely....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, my dear.&rdquo; Herodias laughed. &ldquo;The other Herod
Philip, her father&rsquo;s half brother and&rdquo;&mdash;she grinned&mdash;&ldquo;my half
uncle. He rules the puny tetrarchy over east of us, Batanea and
Trachonitis. He&rsquo;s considerably older than Salome, naturally,
but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s Salome&rsquo;s half great-uncle and half uncle as well as
half stepuncle, and ... well....&rdquo; Claudia broke off with a
shrug. &ldquo;You Herods really never let anything get out of the family,
do you?&rdquo; Then she was serious. &ldquo;But what about old King Aretas?
If he should attack Antipas....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly he hasn&rsquo;t attacked yet,&rdquo; Herodias hastened to reply.
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">317</span>
&ldquo;And he probably never will. But even if he does, that might just
strengthen Antipas with Rome. At any rate,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;the
Arabian isn&rsquo;t making trouble at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Herodias, what if Sejanus, instead of putting Judaea under
Antipas and making him king, should send out a new Procurator
to succeed Pilate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tetrarchess of Galilee and Peraea was not abashed. &ldquo;In that
case,&rdquo; she replied without hesitation, &ldquo;he might even make Longinus
Procurator, although I&rsquo;m sure he&mdash;and surely you too,
wouldn&rsquo;t you&mdash;would prefer to be assigned a post in some province
other than Judaea. But in any event, Claudia, if Longinus
should very strongly recommend and urge the transfer of Pilate
and the extension of Antipas&rsquo; realm to embrace Judaea, then I&rsquo;m
confident it would have great weight with Sejanus. That&rsquo;s why I
came to see you, Claudia, the principal reason, I mean. I hope
you&rsquo;ll suggest such a course to Longinus. It&rsquo;s a way by which you
and Longinus and I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not considering Pilate and indolent old
Antipas&mdash;can attain what all three of us want most.&rdquo; She leaned
forward again, and her expression betrayed a malevolent cunning.
&ldquo;Claudia, Longinus would have good reason to advise Sejanus to
withdraw Pilate from Judaea. Pilate from his first days out here
has failed to get along with the Jews, from the High Priest on
down. And now, today, the suddenly bitter hostility of the followers
of this Galilean fellow whom he tried this morning....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Galilean fellow?&rdquo; Claudia&rsquo;s expression was suddenly grave.
&ldquo;Who...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you haven&rsquo;t heard of him. He has a large following devotedly
attached to him, so large that the Temple leaders are both
jealous and fearful of him. They brought him before Pilate this
morning, and the Procurator, wishing to evade responsibility&rdquo;&mdash;her
tone was sarcastic&mdash;&ldquo;sent him to Antipas for trial, since the
fellow was a Galilean, from the village of Nazareth, I believe. But
I learned about it in time to warn Antipas to have nothing to do with
the fellow....&rdquo; She paused, and the bitter lines around her
mouth deepened in a scowl. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never forgotten that Wilderness
fanatic at Machaerus. So he sent the Galilean back to Pilate.&rdquo;
She smiled. &ldquo;Whatever the Procurator does with him, or has done,
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
will add to his troubles with the Jews ...&rdquo; she paused&mdash;&ldquo;or at
any rate, we hope so, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know whether Pilate has tried the man?&rdquo;
Claudia tried to conceal her anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I only know that Antipas didn&rsquo;t fall into Pilate&rsquo;s trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>... Thank the Bountiful Mother I sent Pilate the message....</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;You were always a clever one, Herodias. Antipas is fortunate.&rdquo;
But she did not elaborate and quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>With the same suddenness that it had begun, like the opening
and closing of a great door, the storm ended, and the sun shone
down through skies sparkling and refreshed. &ldquo;I must be going,&rdquo;
said Herodias. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve much to do before we start back to Tiberias.
My dear&rdquo;&mdash;she laid her hand affectionately on Claudia&rsquo;s arm and
stood up&mdash;&ldquo;do come to visit us again. And won&rsquo;t you talk with
Longinus about this? You&rsquo;ll be seeing him, of course, perhaps
tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; But Claudia&rsquo;s smile was thin.</p>
<p>Herodias&rsquo; visit and the dissipation of the storm clouds had done
nothing to dispel Claudia&rsquo;s misgivings; the news brought by the
Tetrarchess had, in fact, served to deepen her foreboding. Why
hadn&rsquo;t Pilate acknowledged receiving her message, if indeed he
had received it? Suddenly the desperate notion possessed her that
the Procurator had failed to get her hurriedly scribbled warning.
And why, if he had seen it, had he failed to reassure her that
Jesus would not be condemned? What, by the gods, had Pilate
done with him?</p>
<p>She summoned her maid. &ldquo;You must go up to Antonia and discover
what&rsquo;s happened to the Galilean, Tullia,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Until
I hear, I shall have no peace.&rdquo; She hesitated, brow furrowed. &ldquo;No,
wait. I&rsquo;ll go myself. Call the sedan-chair bearers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
<h2 id="c53">53</h2>
<p>When Herodias returned to the Hasmonean Palace she learned
from Neaera that the Tetrarch had shut himself away from all
company in the seclusion of one of the inner chambers. He seemed
to be entering a period of depression, the maid reported, like the
one into which he had plunged after the beheading of the Wilderness
prophet.</p>
<p>The Tetrarchess found him sprawled in his chair, staring at
the wall, his heavy jowls sagging. For a moment he appeared unmindful
of her entrance. Then he turned ponderously to face
her. &ldquo;The Galilean,&rdquo; he said slowly, as though in pain, &ldquo;is dead.
Crucified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead already? How did you learn it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joanna. She was at the Hill of the Skull with some of his
friends, including Mary of Magdala. They saw him die. But she
declared she knew that the Galilean&rdquo;&mdash;suddenly his dull eyes
brightened with the pain of sharpened fear&mdash;&ldquo;would rise from the
dead and avenge himself upon his enemies. Herodias&rdquo;&mdash;he got
heavily to his feet and flung out his hands in desperation&mdash;&ldquo;why
did you make me do it? By the beard of the High Priest, Tetrarchess,
why, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you mad, Antipas?&rdquo; Her dark eyes snapped. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
kill him! By the gods, Pilate did. The Procurator tried him. You
sent him back to Pilate, don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I sent him back to Pilate. But I had it in my power
to free him; instead, I sent him to his death. When he rises, he
will wreak upon me a double vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Double vengeance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the vengeance of both the prophet of the Wilderness and
of the Nazarene.&rdquo; His eyes glittered with incipient madness. &ldquo;The
<span class="pb" id="Page_320">320</span>
Nazarene was the prophet returned to life. When he arises, he
will be the two returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Herodias advanced, her eyes flaming, and grasped
her husband&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;If the Galilean is dead, he&rsquo;s dead, and you
know it. Must you give heed to Joanna&rsquo;s superstitious drivel?&rdquo; Her
scowl lightened into a crafty smile. &ldquo;Pilate has served you well in
crucifying this fellow. Can&rsquo;t you see that the Galilean&rsquo;s followers
will be all the more determined to do the Procurator ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will his misfortune help me?&rdquo; the Tetrarch asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father ruled this whole province. Should Pilate&rsquo;s mishandling
of his duties drive him from the Procuratorship, the
Emperor might elevate you to king of all the region. It&rsquo;s not for
nothing that your father is called &lsquo;Herod the Great.&rsquo;&rdquo; She shook
a ringed forefinger under his nose. &ldquo;If you had one-fourth the
ambition and energy that he had, you&rsquo;d already be wearing the
crown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to wear a crown,&rdquo; Antipas protested. &ldquo;Crowns
often become greater burdens than they&rsquo;re worth. We can live
out our lives at Tiberias, happy and unchallenged, and enjoy the
benefits of the royal prerogative without risking its dangers and
burdens, my dear, and with considerably less chance of drawing
the ire of old Sejanus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herodias stamped her foot angrily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have any aspirations,
Antipas? Are you willing to continue being a mouse instead
of a man?&rdquo; Her tone was coldly sarcastic, and she knotted her
hand into a fist to emphasize her stern words. &ldquo;Well, by the
beard of the High Priest, Antipas, I&rsquo;m going to see to it that you
sit on the throne of Judaea as your father did. I&rsquo;ve just returned
from talking with Claudia about my plan ... and my determination
... to get you elevated to kingship. She will help; she
wants to see Pilate disgraced so that she can divorce him and marry
Longinus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, my dear Tetrarchess. What would
be the difference anyway, except in titles? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be best to
let well enough...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And spend the rest of our lives in an out-of-the-way poor district
of illiterate fishermen and grape growers! Never!&rdquo; she stormed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
&ldquo;Would you be willing for me never to occupy a station higher
than Salome, by all the gods?&rdquo; She studied him, her contempt
plainly revealed. &ldquo;I do believe you <i>would</i>. Well, I&rsquo;m not willing.
I&rsquo;ll leave you first ... and go back to Rome!&rdquo; She was silent for
a moment and when he made no retort, continued. &ldquo;This is what
we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; she said, her tone even now. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll return to Tiberias
and begin to assemble choice presents for the Emperor, and most
important, for Sejanus. And you will increase the revenue going
to the Prefect. The gifts will please and flatter him, and the increased
revenues from Galilee and Peraea may suggest to him that
if you were governing the whole province the increase in taxes
would be substantial. And we won&rsquo;t send them to Rome, the gifts,
I mean, but we&rsquo;ll take them ourselves, and then we can personally
petition Sejanus to make you king over the entire province.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herod Antipas shook his grizzled head slowly, and his countenance
was troubled. &ldquo;But I foresee only disaster if....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you foresee or how agitated you may become,&rdquo;
she said, with a defiant toss of her head, &ldquo;we are going
to Rome to ask the Prefect to make you king, and I&rsquo;m either coming
back to Palestine as queen or I&rsquo;m not coming back at all!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c54">54</h2>
<p>As Claudia and her maid entered the anteroom adjacent to the
Procurator&rsquo;s great chamber in the southwestern tower of Antonia,
two men of serious mien, well-dressed and with beards oiled and
carefully braided, emerged from Pilate&rsquo;s room and walked quickly
into the corridor.</p>
<p>Claudia motioned Tullia to a seat and without pausing strode
past the attendant through the still unclosed doorway.</p>
<p>Pilate stood before one of the windows facing westward. His
long shadow reached out to her feet across the high-domed room;
<span class="pb" id="Page_322">322</span>
soon now the sun would be dropping beneath the wall of the
ancient city, and the solemnity of the Jewish Sabbath would still
the Passover festivities. He turned to face his wife, and she saw
that his expression was deadly serious. She questioned him with a
lift of her head. &ldquo;Those men who just went out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wealthy Jews,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;One of them anyway, a merchant
from Arimathea. Both of them members of the Sanhedrin. They
came to petition me.&rdquo; He saw that she was still not satisfied. &ldquo;A
small matter; they asked for the body of one of the men crucified
today. They want to bury him.&rdquo; He advanced toward her and
managed a thin smile. &ldquo;Here, my dear Claudia,&rdquo; he pointed, &ldquo;have
this chair.&rdquo; His smile warmed. &ldquo;To what am I indebted for the
honor of your visit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man whose body they wished,&rdquo; she asked, ignoring his
question, &ldquo;could it be that he was the Galilean mystic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they said he was from Galilee.&rdquo; His eyes avoided her
probing stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was called Jesus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they called him that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you did not receive my message ... about the dream
I had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw in his eyes a mounting panic. &ldquo;Yes, Claudia, but it was
only a dream, and the High Priest demanded....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You condemned to the cross an innocent man&rdquo;&mdash;she stood up
and pointed a trembling finger at the Procurator, and her eyes
blazed furiously&mdash;&ldquo;because the High Priest demanded it! The
great Procurator, representative of imperial Rome, <i>crucified</i> an innocent
man because a jealous and mean little Temple strut-cock
<i>ordered</i> you to send him to the cross! By all the gods, Pilate, <i>and</i>
you condemned him after <i>I</i> sent you that warning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Claudia, I was being pulled at from both sides. I didn&rsquo;t
want to condemn him. I told them I found no fault in the man.
I had a basin of water fetched and before the multitude I washed
my hands of his blood, and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You washed your hands of his blood! Never! Oh, by all the
gods, those hands! Those blood-red, crawling, slinking hands!&rdquo; She
<span class="pb" id="Page_323">323</span>
held her palms before her face. &ldquo;In the dream I saw them. Now
you&rsquo;ll never be able to cleanse those foul, polluted hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I had released him, Claudia, and news had got back to
the Prefect that I had allowed a dangerous revolutionary to go
free....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew he was no revolutionary.&rdquo; Her voice was almost a
hiss. &ldquo;You knew he was an innocent man, and you sent him to
the cross.&rdquo; She crossed the room quickly and looked out toward
the Hill of the Skull. The shadows were heavy in the square before
Antonia, but the sinking sun shone levelly upon the three
burdened crosses on the hill. &ldquo;Which cross is his?&rdquo; she asked,
without taking her eyes from the macabre scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one at the center,&rdquo; he replied, his eyes fixed unseeing on
the polished surface of his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he is dead, you&rsquo;re sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve sent for the centurion in charge of the
execution, and now I&rsquo;m waiting for his report. I told the two
Jews I would not release the body until I was certain the Galilean
was dead. Should the body be taken down and the man revived,
and should word, as it would, get to Rome....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you concerned only with what sort of reports go to Rome?&rdquo;
she demanded, her voice heavy with sarcasm. &ldquo;Have you no interest
in seeing justice prevail even in Judaea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am interested, my dear Claudia&rdquo;&mdash;he appeared somewhat to
have regained his composure&mdash;&ldquo;in maintaining myself in the office
of Procurator. Perhaps I erred in the case of this Galilean. Perhaps
I should have given greater heed to the message you sent me.
But I&rsquo;ve spent many hard years in the army, and I have long
dreamed of being the Procurator of a province of imperial Rome.
Now that I have attained it, I must not gain the further enmity of
the Temple leadership, or I might lose the post, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your only concern is in remaining Procurator of Judaea?&rdquo;
Her tone was coldly scornful. &ldquo;And you might have the post taken
from you, at that. Much depends, you know, on the attitude of
the Prefect toward you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate blanched. &ldquo;But, my dear, surely you wouldn&rsquo;t suggest to
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
him that he carry to Sejanus an evil report about my conduct of
affairs....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <i>him</i>? To whom, Excellency&rdquo;&mdash;she paused, and her tone was
taunting&mdash;&ldquo;do you refer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But once more he was evasive. &ldquo;Perhaps you are tired, my dear,&rdquo;
he said with a short, humorless laugh. &ldquo;Perhaps you should return
to the palace. I can order the sedan-chair bearers....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine are outside,&rdquo; she replied evenly. &ldquo;But why are you trying
to get rid of me, Pilate? Does the Galilean haunt you already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no.&rdquo; Again he attempted a laugh, but it lacked conviction.
&ldquo;Any minute now the centurion will be reporting to me,
and I thought perhaps you would not wish to be reminded again
of the Galilean&rsquo;s death or your strange dream....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I will stay. Perhaps it is you who do not wish to be reminded
that you condemned to a terrible death a man innocent
of the crime charged against him, innocent of any crime, and
known by you to be innocent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Claudia, had I freed....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Procurator&rsquo;s protest was interrupted by a knock on the
door, and a moment later at Pilate&rsquo;s bidding the attendant entered.
&ldquo;The Centurion Longinus, Excellency,&rdquo; he said, bowing,
&ldquo;has arrived to make his report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longinus! By great Jupiter, did you send Longinus to crucify
the Galilean?&rdquo; She whirled to face the centurion, who had entered
the chamber. &ldquo;Surely, Longinus, you didn&rsquo;t...&rdquo; Abruptly she
stopped; her face, suddenly drained of fury, betrayed apprehension
and pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I killed him. I was ordered by the Procurator
to do so, but that doesn&rsquo;t absolve me from guilt. I crucified an
innocent man&rdquo;&mdash;his eyes shifted to level on Pilate&mdash;&ldquo;as the Procurator
well knew when he condemned him to the cross.&rdquo; He
paused, but Pilate did not challenge the statement. &ldquo;Excellency,
you sent for me to report. The Galilean is dead. Your order has
been carried out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Centurion. Then I shall grant those Jews&rsquo; request
for the body for burial.&rdquo; He spoke calmly, but his flustered manner
betrayed an inner stress. &ldquo;You may return to your duty and
<span class="pb" id="Page_325">325</span>
notify the men, who will be at the execution ground, that I grant
their petition. You may have your quaternion help them remove
the body from the cross and ...&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off suddenly. Through the slit in the doorway, which
Longinus had failed to close completely behind him, came the
insistent voice of a man talking with Pilate&rsquo;s aide in the anteroom.
&ldquo;By the gods, I&rsquo;m glad to catch him. I&rsquo;ve come from Caesarea with
a message for him from the Commander Sergius Paulus. And I was
given emphatic instructions to deliver it myself into his hands
with the seals unbroken,&rdquo; they heard the man say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
searching all over Jerusalem for him; I even went out to the crucifixion
hill.&rdquo; He lowered his voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bound to be an important
message. It came from Rome, probably, by the gods, from the
Prefect or even the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Centurion, perhaps you&rsquo;d prefer to go out there&rdquo;&mdash;Pilate&rsquo;s face
had paled perceptibly&mdash;&ldquo;to accept the message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus nodded and left the room. As the door closed behind
him, Claudia turned with renewed fury upon her husband. &ldquo;Why
did you assign Longinus to crucify the Galilean?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Was
it because I sent my message by him and you suspected he had
spent the night with me and you finally did me the small honor
of being jealous? Well, by the gods&rdquo;&mdash;her voice was tremulous as
her anger rose&mdash;&ldquo;<i>that&rsquo;s exactly what he did</i>!&rdquo; With hatred in her
eyes she approached him, coming so close that their faces nearly
touched. &ldquo;And, you fool, that wasn&rsquo;t the first time,&rdquo; she added
with a low, harsh laugh, &ldquo;nor even, by Jupiter, the last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Procurator stepped back and sank heavily into his chair.
For a long moment he sat silent, staring at the floor. Then he
raised his eyes to his wife&rsquo;s bitter, scornful face. &ldquo;Surely you cannot
believe me that stupid, Claudia my dear,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;to
think that I haven&rsquo;t known. Surely you must know that I am not
entirely deaf and blind, that I have even contrived to spend many
an evening away so that you....&rdquo; He paused, pensively contemplating
the woman before him. &ldquo;But perhaps you don&rsquo;t
know....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how I despise you!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;I knew you were a
weakling, a coward, a ... yes, today, even a murderer. But I
<span class="pb" id="Page_326">326</span>
didn&rsquo;t know you were a crawling worm who would willingly lend
his wife to another man! By all Pluto&rsquo;s fire-blackened imps, I....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the Procurator went on, &ldquo;that I
was commanded by the Prefect and the Emperor, at the time our
marriage was arranged, to do everything possible to keep you content
in this dismal province ... even to overlooking any indiscretions....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve been willing to do anything, by the Great Mother,
in order to stay in the good graces of old Sejanus,&rdquo; Claudia hissed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re willing to send a good and innocent man, maybe a god-man,
to the cross rather than displease a contemptible High Priest
who might complain against you to the Prefect!&rdquo; She clenched her
fists and brought them down, hard, across the desk. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re even
willing to surrender your wife to another man&rsquo;s enjoyment in
order&mdash;you said it&mdash;to keep her &lsquo;content&rsquo; but <i>really</i> to keep that
man from reporting to Sejanus your bumbling incompetence, your
foolish provocations, your utter imbecility!&rdquo; Her voice had risen
to a shout. Slowly she moved toward the window, and then she
whirled about to face him again. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not &lsquo;content,&rsquo; and I
never will be ... with you! And by all the gods, I hope Longinus
will go to Rome and reveal to Sejanus how miserably you have
administered the affairs of the Empire in this province!&rdquo; She
pointed at him from across the room. &ldquo;And how you have dragged
in the dust Rome&rsquo;s vaunted justice, how in all probability&rdquo;&mdash;her
voice dropped to a menacing tone&mdash;&ldquo;you have withheld funds
from the Empire&rsquo;s treasury....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Oh, no, Claudia! I have kept back nothing due the Empire
or the Prefect! Nothing! Not one shekel, not a denarius!
Longinus knows it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; He lowered his voice. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he been
watching; hasn&rsquo;t he been reporting? Surely you don&rsquo;t think I
haven&rsquo;t suspected....&rdquo; But suddenly he broke off his protests.
Quickly crossing the chamber, he opened the door and summoned
the centurion. &ldquo;You have heard my wife&rsquo;s words?&rdquo; he asked, as he
closed the door behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard excited words,&rdquo; Longinus replied cautiously. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t get the full import of them, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claudia has been hurling accusations at me. She said she hoped
<span class="pb" id="Page_327">327</span>
you would report me to the Prefect when you go to....&rdquo; He
paused, and both his face and voice revealed his fear. &ldquo;The message
was from Rome, wasn&rsquo;t it? From Sejanus? He asked you to
report to him on the situation out here, how I&rsquo;m administering...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked me to come at once to Rome, but he said only that
it was to meet with him on a matter of utmost concern, the nature
of which he did not indicate. Here, Excellency&rdquo;&mdash;he handed the
letter to the Procurator&mdash;&ldquo;you may read it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly the Procurator accepted the message. His forehead
creased as he studied it. &ldquo;True,&rdquo; he said, handing it back to Longinus,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no mention in it of the Procurator. But surely the
Prefect will ask you how I&rsquo;m administering affairs. I beg of you,
Centurion, don&rsquo;t give him an unfavorable report; don&rsquo;t make any
charges against....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of the Galilean you&rsquo;ve just crucified?&rdquo; Claudia interrupted.
&ldquo;Can you contend that you even thought you were acting
justly? Didn&rsquo;t you just tell me you found no fault in the man?
What else could Longinus tell the Prefect concerning your
trial...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the centurion will say nothing of this Galilean, surely.&rdquo;
The trace of a sickly smile flickered across his round face. &ldquo;The
centurion will remember that it was <i>he</i> who crucified the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall never forget that I killed him,&rdquo; Longinus said. &ldquo;And
I suspect that to the end of his days the Procurator, too, will remember
the part he played in this horrible thing. But if this Galilean&rsquo;s
case comes to the Prefect&rsquo;s attention and he inquires of
me about it, I shall reveal fully what happened, and why I was
involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely, Centurion, unless you report it, Sejanus will never
know about it. Caiaphas is pleased. The illiterate, poor followers
of the Galilean didn&rsquo;t even attempt to aid him at the trial; their
protests, if they offer any, can never reach as far as Rome. I beg
of you, Longinus, make no mention of it to the Prefect. The
Galilean is dead; soon he&rsquo;ll be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Claudia protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget him! Longinus will
never forget him! Nor will <i>you</i>! Look at your hands, Pilate. Soon
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
you will be seeing them as I saw them, cold, clammy, scurrying to
hide themselves under the rocks, foul and evil and reeking with
<i>his</i> blood! By all the gods, Pilate&rdquo;&mdash;her voice was shrill in newly
mounting anger&mdash;&ldquo;if Longinus doesn&rsquo;t tell the Prefect of your
cowardly flouting of Roman justice, <i>I</i> will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Procurator&rsquo;s face blanched. He started to speak, then swallowed.
&ldquo;Claudia, my dear, you wouldn&rsquo;t. Surely you wouldn&rsquo;t be
so....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I would! I have lost all patience with you, Pilate. Today
I&rsquo;ve seen you as I&rsquo;ve never seen you before. You&rsquo;re a small
man, Procurator, vain, self-seeking, pompous, and yet a sniveling
coward too fearful for his own skin to rule justly. And at the first
opportunity I shall so describe you to the Prefect ... and perhaps
to the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear! No! Please....&rdquo; His panic changed quickly into
abject pleading. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t, my dear. Why should you wish to
ruin me? What would it gain you ... and Longinus?&rdquo; He sat
down wearily behind his desk. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we continue as we
have been ...&rdquo; he paused, &ldquo;enduring this trying land and these
troublesome people? Centurion&rdquo;&mdash;he faced Longinus&mdash;&ldquo;for a long
time I have suspected, and known, the ... situation. But haven&rsquo;t
I been understanding, even co-operative?&rdquo; The suggestion of a smile
lifted the corners of his mouth. &ldquo;Why, then, cannot the three of
us, understanding this and appreciating it, just continue to play the
roles as we have been? Why can&rsquo;t we...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by great Ceres!&rdquo; Claudia shouted angrily, &ldquo;you are indeed
a crawling worm! You <i>invite</i> another man to your wife&rsquo;s bed! You
pander! You&rsquo;re nothing but a procurer, a Spanish pimp! Gods, but
I detest you!&rdquo; Turning, she strode to the door and opened it.
&ldquo;Summon my sedan-chair bearers,&rdquo; she ordered the attendant,
&ldquo;and quickly!&rdquo; Then she wheeled about to face the Procurator
again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to the palace. I cannot summon the patience
to remain longer in your presence. It would please me
greatly if I should never lay eyes on you again!&rdquo; She stormed
through the doorway; the door slammed behind her.</p>
<p>Pilate sat unmoving and stared stonily into space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A moment ago, Excellency,&rdquo; Longinus ventured, &ldquo;you directed
<span class="pb" id="Page_329">329</span>
me to return to the Hill of the Skull. The Jewish Sabbath is fast
nearing. Perhaps I should go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without raising his eyes, Pontius Pilate nodded. Longinus
crossed the darkening chamber and went out. After a while the
Procurator stood up and walked to the window. Out beyond Antonia&rsquo;s
front square and the squat stone structures flanking it, on
a wretched knoll beyond the city&rsquo;s wall, the three crosses still
lifted their quiet burdens into the waning light. But already the
shadow of the wall was groping for the pinioned feet of the man
on the middle cross. For a long moment Pilate stood rooted before
the window; when the shadow had climbed to engulf the
man&rsquo;s sagging knees, he turned slowly away and sat again in his
big chair. As the gloom thickened in the great chamber, the staring
Procurator leaned slowly forward to cross his arms on the desk
and, bending over, cradled his round head on their crossing.</p>
<h2 id="c55">55</h2>
<p>Late in the afternoon of the Jews&rsquo; Sabbath the Procurator Pontius
Pilate stood face to face once again with the High Priest Joseph
Caiaphas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My visit to you, Excellency, and the petition I bring,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;concern that impostor and revolutionary you crucified yesterday,
the one who was seeking to establish himself upon the restored
throne of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the man is dead and buried,&rdquo; Pilate spoke up irritably.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you let him lie quietly in his tomb? Can&rsquo;t you understand
that I wish to have no further mention made to me of that
Galilean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do understand, Excellency. That&rsquo;s exactly what we
also wish, to allow him to lie quietly and undisturbed until his
body rots and his name is forgotten.&rdquo; He leaned forward, and his
<span class="pb" id="Page_330">330</span>
black eyes lighted with new fires. &ldquo;But, Excellency, as you may
have been told, that blasphemer was heard to declare that he
would destroy our Temple and in three days with his own hands
rebuild it. Now some of his deluded followers are saying that he
wasn&rsquo;t speaking of the Temple yonder&rdquo;&mdash;he nodded in the direction
of the great structure&mdash;&ldquo;but rather of his own physical body.
They interpret his words as meaning that he would of his own
accord give his life and then on the third day claim it again and
walk forth from his tomb. Of course, Excellency, we know that the
fellow is dead and will never rise again&rdquo;&mdash;with the tip of his
tongue he licked his thin red lips&mdash;&ldquo;but many na&iuml;ve ones may be
deluded into believing that he really did possess power to call
back his life. Even today a report has reached us that certain of
his followers are planning in the nighttime to visit the tomb and
steal away the body. Then with the tomb empty on the morrow,
which will be the third day since he died, they can publish abroad
the tidings that the blasphemer really did arise as he had declared
he would do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how am I concerned in this nonsense?&rdquo; Pilate was plainly
annoyed. &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would have you set a guard over the fellow&rsquo;s tomb, Excellency,
to see that no one steals away the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this but children&rsquo;s prattle? Surely no one would seriously
expect a dead man to walk from his tomb.&rdquo; Slowly Pilate&rsquo;s
scowl gave way to a mocking half-smile. &ldquo;What would the High
Priest do if the Galilean <i>did</i> rise? <i>You</i> contrived his crucifixion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what, Excellency, would the Procurator do? <i>You crucified</i>
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate was not amused by the High Priest&rsquo;s retort. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s
as well,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;that neither of us will be so tested.&rdquo; For a
moment he was silent, looking away. Then he turned back to
face Caiaphas. &ldquo;You have your Temple guards. Can&rsquo;t you use
some of them to guard that tomb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Excellency, with the great surge of Passover pilgrims still
in the Temple courts and about the cattle stalls and the money
changers&rsquo; tables, our guards are all greatly needed. And, more important,
your placing a guard would lend greater prestige....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_331">331</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Antonia garrison is just as busy,&rdquo; Pilate interrupted, &ldquo;and
many of our soldiers are leaving Jerusalem. Maybe, though, I can
arrange yet again to humor the High Priest.&rdquo; He beckoned to an
aide. &ldquo;Summon the fortress commander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any centurions available for a special assignment beginning
at once and continuing into tomorrow?&rdquo; he asked, when a
few moments later the officer appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Centurion Longinus, sir, is....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, by all the gods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only other one not assigned at the present is Centurion
Cornelius. He&rsquo;s preparing to return his....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then call Cornelius in and instruct him to select from his
century a sufficient detail and mount a guard at the tomb of the
Galilean&rdquo;&mdash;he paused and looked unsmiling toward the High
Priest&mdash;&ldquo;rather, the &lsquo;King of the Jews,&rsquo; to see that it is not disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caiaphas smiled grimly but made no comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, O High Priest, you will have your guard, though I consider
a guard unnecessary. Once again your will has prevailed.&rdquo;
He bowed, and his smile was cold. &ldquo;I trust your sleep tonight
will be peaceful.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c56">56</h2>
<p>It was within two hours of midnight after the Jewish Sabbath,
which by Hebrew reckoning ended at sundown, when Longinus
came to the Palace of the Herods. Claudia was already in her
nightdress and prepared for bed. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to spend the
night?&rdquo; she asked eagerly, after he loosened her from their warm
embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your permission,&rdquo; he said, grinning wryly. &ldquo;I have your
husband&rsquo;s, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_332">332</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please, let&rsquo;s not talk of him.&rdquo; Her expression sobered. &ldquo;Did I
speak too frankly yesterday, Longinus? Did I reveal too much to
him ... about us, I mean? Is that why you didn&rsquo;t come last
night? You were annoyed with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really spoke your feelings, didn&rsquo;t you? But I wasn&rsquo;t annoyed
with you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;m glad you spoke up. And I
suspect he was not surprised at what you told him, only that you
would say it, and with such fury.&rdquo; She had sat down on the side
of her bed. He seated himself beside her and bent over to unfasten
his sandals. Then he straightened and faced her. &ldquo;Claudia, I was
too depressed last night to be good company.&rdquo; He shook his head
slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been in lower spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the Galilean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Because of what I had done. It felt like a crushing load
on my back. I couldn&rsquo;t get out from under it.&rdquo; He stood up, and
laid his tunic across a chair. &ldquo;After I left you and Pilate, I went
back out to the crosses and helped get him down, taking care to
see that in pulling the nails out we didn&rsquo;t tear or further bruise
the flesh&rdquo;&mdash;he paused in his narration, and his low laugh was hollow,
mirthless&mdash;&ldquo;after I had seen the nails driven through the living
flesh and had plunged my lance into his side. Then we put
him in the rich Jew&rsquo;s tomb; they had bound the body the way
the Jews prepare their dead for burial, although they didn&rsquo;t have
time to anoint it with aromatic spices as they customarily do....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are going to do that tomorrow,&rdquo; Claudia interrupted him.
&ldquo;Tullia has gone out to Bethany to go with Mary of Magdala and
Chuza&rsquo;s wife Joanna and some other followers of the Galilean
early in the morning to the tomb to finish the burial rites.&rdquo; She
paused. &ldquo;But I interrupted your story. What did you do when
you had finished out there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came back to Antonia and sat for a long time on the balcony
looking out over the Temple courts. Then I went to bed and tried
to get some sleep, but I couldn&rsquo;t, no matter how I tried. Every
time I closed my eyes I saw that man ... the death march out
to the hill, nailing him down, lifting him to the upright....&rdquo;
He cupped his palm across his eyes. &ldquo;By the gods, Claudia, it was
terrible, frightening. And his crying out to his god to forgive us.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_333">333</span>
His hand dropped listlessly to his side. &ldquo;Well, I finally gave up and
walked out along the balcony again, and then I went to see Cornelius.
He was troubled, too. He hadn&rsquo;t gone to bed. We sat and
talked, mostly about that man, until daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you come to any conclusion ... about him, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I suppose not, except that it was a monstrous crime
to crucify such a man, though Cornelius still held to the idea that
the Galilean probably was a god of some sort, that he had supernatural
powers, even the ability to heal people&mdash;he insisted that
he had healed his little Lucian&mdash;maybe to raise dead people to
life. Cornelius even said he thought it was possible that the
Galilean might come to life himself, as some of his followers say
he will, and walk out of that tomb.&rdquo; He was silent for a moment.
&ldquo;If he does,&rdquo; he added after awhile, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have to move a tremendous
stone from the mouth of the tomb ... and <i>from the
inside</i>.&rdquo; He sat down again beside her. &ldquo;And under the noses of
the guards, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. At the insistence of the High Priest, Pilate has set a guard
at the tomb to prevent the Galilean&rsquo;s followers from stealing the
body and claiming that he actually did come to life. The Procurator
put Cornelius in charge, and I went out there with him; in
fact, I&rsquo;ve just come from there. Cornelius is going to stay until
daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Pilate is still trying to appease the High Priest, even after
all I said to him yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently. The Procurator isn&rsquo;t likely to change his ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I was rash yesterday in losing my temper and speaking
with such boldness, but I&rsquo;ve come to have such contempt for him,
to loathe him so. Oh, Longinus&rdquo;&mdash;she clutched his arm in both
hands and clung to him&mdash;&ldquo;how can I stay with him longer in this
dreary land? Please take me with you to Rome. Hasn&rsquo;t the time
come...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here, Claudia.&rdquo; Then his serious expression
softened, and his eyes teased. &ldquo;And because it&rsquo;s my last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you be leaving tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m going with Cornelius as far as Tiberias. From there
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">334</span>
I&rsquo;ll go across to Ptolema&iuml;s and get a ship for Rome. Cornelius is
providing me an escort to the coast. I&rsquo;ll have to get the first ship
leaving that port for the capital. But I had to see you before I
left. Claudia&rdquo;&mdash;in the subdued light of the bedchamber the gentle
flame of the wall lamp was mirrored in his eyes as he looked
deeply into hers&mdash;&ldquo;it may be that a way of escape is about to open
for us. By all the gods, it&rsquo;s strange, and distressing, too, but the
death of the Galilean may actually save us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that Pilate in condemning the Galilean may have
condemned himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he has ... in one way or another. And I think he
has given you a means of freeing yourself.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
sure no one can hear us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded. But he went to the door anyway, listened with his
ear to the panel, and tried the bolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is dangerous, Claudia,&rdquo; he said, as he sat down again.
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t breathe a word of it to anybody, not even Tullia.
It could get us both killed.&rdquo; He lowered his voice. &ldquo;That message
I had yesterday. It brought startling news. I purposely showed it to
Pilate, but of course he had no idea what it was saying. But I
did. That &lsquo;matter of utmost concern&rsquo; was the Prefect&rsquo;s way of
notifying me that now he&rsquo;s finally ready to proceed with his scheme
and wants me in Rome when he makes his move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this new scheme? What...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a new one, Claudia. He gave me a broad hint concerning
his plans the last time I was home; he said that when I got a
message so worded it would mean he was ready to proceed with
the final step.&rdquo; He leaned close to her. &ldquo;Claudia, Sejanus is plotting
<i>to have the Emperor assassinated</i>; he is bidding for the
throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely&rdquo;&mdash;her face had paled&mdash;&ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t mean for you
to ...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not that. Some palace servant out at Capri will probably
attend to that. But he wants me in Rome when it&rsquo;s done so
that I can help rally his supporters at the crucial moment and
make him Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_335">335</div>
<p>&ldquo;But even if Sejanus should become Emperor, how would that
help us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be much closer to him than I am now, one of his advisors,&rdquo;
the centurion replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I could poison him against
Pilate, and justly. This case of the Galilean will be just one more
example of his unfitness to administer Roman government. His
failure to conciliate, his forever keeping Judaea in a stir....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Longinus&rdquo;&mdash;her face revealed sudden apprehension, fear&mdash;&ldquo;what
if the Emperor&rsquo;s supporters should discover the Prefect&rsquo;s
plotting and kill <i>him</i> before he could have the Emperor killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I would have been on the Emperor&rsquo;s side.&rdquo; Longinus
smiled reassuringly and patted the back of her hand on his arm.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me; I&rsquo;ll not let myself get trapped. And soon
now, either way the dice fall, we&rsquo;ll be the winners.&rdquo; He stood up
and quickly lifted her to her feet. Leaning over, he pulled down the
light coverlet. &ldquo;But for now, my dearest,&rdquo; he said, as he gently
pushed her down and lifted her legs to the bed, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s forget them
all; let&rsquo;s make what&rsquo;s left of it <i>our</i> night.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c57">57</h2>
<p>Once more she felt herself floating upward in a dark morass of
confused and tangled dreaming. Then as she seemed to burst
through the heavy waters to the surface and a sudden effulgent
light, she sat up, eyes blinking and sleep drained from her.</p>
<p>The knocking and calling were restrained but insistent from
Tullia&rsquo;s side of the door. &ldquo;Mistress! Oh, Mistress! Mistress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang from the bed. &ldquo;Just a moment, little one, until I
can draw back the bolt.&rdquo; The movement and her exclamation awakened
Longinus; precipitately he sat up in bed. &ldquo;Tullia&rsquo;s returned,&rdquo;
she explained to him, as he blinked sleepily. She opened the door.
&ldquo;Bona Dea, you&rsquo;re breathless,&rdquo; she said to the girl. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened,
by great Ceres?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_336">336</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve run all the way from the Hasmonean Palace where I left
Joanna....&rdquo; She paused, breathing hard. &ldquo;Mistress&rdquo;&mdash;her face
flamed with new excitement&mdash;&ldquo;Jesus is <i>alive</i>! He&rsquo;s come from the
tomb alive! He did it, Mistress! He really did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Tullia,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re excited, little one.
Calm yourself. Longinus told me that the Galilean was not in a
trance; he said he knew he was dead; he said....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was dead, Mistress, I know. But <i>now</i> he&rsquo;s alive again! He&rsquo;s
<i>alive</i>, Mistress, <i>alive</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claudia shook her head dubiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt that you think
so, but when a man&rsquo;s dead....&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been
under such tension, so troubled....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m no longer troubled, Mistress,&rdquo; Tullia said calmly.
&ldquo;Nor have I lost my reason. He <i>is</i> alive. Mary of Magdala talked
with him at the tomb. We&rsquo;ve just come from there, Mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where were Cornelius and his soldiers? Surely they didn&rsquo;t
all go to sleep and let the Galilean&rsquo;s friends....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had gone,&rdquo; the maid answered. &ldquo;But nobody stole the
body, Mistress. Jesus walked away. He told Mary to tell those of
his company that he would meet them down in Galilee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Cornelius and his guards weren&rsquo;t at the tomb when the
Galilean walked from it, Tullia?&rdquo; Longinus, adjusting his tunic,
came through the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Centurion, I meant they were gone when we got
there. But they had left only a few minutes before. In fact, we
met them coming in through the city gate as we were going out.
I recognized Centurion Cornelius, although I don&rsquo;t think he noticed
me. He seemed greatly disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, by the gods, Claudia, I must go find him. This is amazing.
Tullia, by great Jupiter, do you know what you&rsquo;re saying? Do
you realize that you are saying a dead man....?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His question was interrupted by a knocking on the corridor door.
Quickly Tullia opened it. A palace servant announced that Centurion
Cornelius was trying to find Centurion Longinus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to come in,&rdquo; Claudia had overheard. &ldquo;The Centurion
Longinus is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying since daylight to locate you, Longinus,&rdquo; he
<span class="pb" id="Page_337">337</span>
reported. &ldquo;I went to your quarters, but I should have known....&rdquo;
He didn&rsquo;t finish the observation. &ldquo;Something very strange has happened.
The Galilean disappeared from his tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Tullia has just told us,&rdquo; Longinus said. &ldquo;She contends that
he came to life and simply walked out.&rdquo; His eyes narrowed. &ldquo;By
the gods, Cornelius, did your guards go to sleep and allow his
friends to slip in and...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Longinus, we weren&rsquo;t asleep.&rdquo; He shook his head slowly.
&ldquo;Nobody was asleep. I can&rsquo;t understand it. I had stationed my
men so that no one could slip past us to get to the tomb. And that
heavy stone ... Longinus, it had to be rolled uphill on its track,
and that requires the hard work of at least two or three strong
men.&rdquo; His forehead wrinkled in a puzzled frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Longinus pursued, &ldquo;what <i>did</i> happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t know. Nothing happened. At least, I saw
and heard nothing. I asked the men later if any of them had, and
they all insisted, to a man, that they hadn&rsquo;t heard a sound or seen
anything the least bit unusual. Only a moment before I had
checked the tomb&rsquo;s mouth. The seal hadn&rsquo;t been disturbed. And
there was a dim light from a little fire we had kindled earlier to
keep off the night chill; it had burned down, but there was still
a light on the stone at the mouth. In fact, that&rsquo;s how we noticed....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Galilean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we didn&rsquo;t see him. But one moment the stone was in
place, and the next ... well, I looked over there, and it had
been rolled up the track and the mouth was wide-open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lighted a torch from the smoldering fire and investigated.
The Galilean was gone, disappeared. The linen strips with which
the body had been wrapped were lying there, still in folds but
collapsed, just as though the body they had been enfolding had
melted away.&rdquo; He shook his head, gestured with palms up. &ldquo;Longinus,
I can&rsquo;t figure it any other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you actually believe he returned to life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the stone? How could he have rolled it back?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_338">338</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he had the power to call back his life,&rdquo; Cornelius said, &ldquo;rolling
away the stone would surely have been no problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Cornelius,&rdquo; Claudia interposed, &ldquo;Tullia, too, has just
come from the tomb. She was there with Mary of Magdala and
Joanna and some other followers of the Galilean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see them....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got there just after you left. They saw you at the city
gate as you were coming away, she said. But Mary of Magdala
saw the Galilean and talked with him.&rdquo; She shrugged. &ldquo;Or at any
rate that&rsquo;s what she told Tullia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The centurion&rsquo;s amazement was not feigned. &ldquo;Then where did
he go? Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to Tullia, he told Mary that he was going down to
Galilee. He said he would meet his band there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may come upon him somewhere, beside the sea with
the fishermen or maybe in Capernaum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Cornelius&rdquo;&mdash;Claudia&rsquo;s expression betrayed a sudden apprehension&mdash;&ldquo;how
would he receive Longinus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a spirit of forgiveness, I hope ... and believe. It was really
not Longinus who did it. The guilt was Herod&rsquo;s and Pilate&rsquo;s ...
and, of course, even more, the High Priest&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cornelius, does Pilate know ... about the empty tomb, I
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Claudia. I reported to him first, before I started to look
for Longinus. He was still in his bedchamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say? How did he act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first he was angry; he charged that the guards had gone to
sleep, said the High Priest would be greatly agitated, and threatened
to punish us severely. But when I stood my ground and insisted
that no one had stolen the body, he began to show concern,
and when I left him he was thoroughly frightened.&rdquo; He turned to
Longinus. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I want to get started as quickly as possible
for Tiberias, before Pilate orders my century to remain in Jerusalem
to help protect him from the Galilean. Can you be ready to
start by midday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus nodded. &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m already packed. All I have to do is
pick up my bags at Antonia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_339">339</div>
<h2 id="c58">58</h2>
<p>When Cornelius left the Palace of the Herods, Claudia and Longinus
walked out into the garden and sat on the stone bench before
the fountain. Already the sun was high in the cloudless heavens
and the air was growing warm. Birds chattered in the trees and
shrubs, and as they watched the spurting water, two small conies
skittered across a circle of sunlight to dark safety beneath a heavily
leaved fig bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A glorious day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He tossed a twig toward the fountain. &ldquo;You know,
Claudia&rdquo;&mdash;he was looking, she saw, at some invisible point beyond
the trembling column of water&mdash;&ldquo;a hundred years from now the
world may still remember this day, if....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Galilean really has come to life?&rdquo; she finished softly.
&ldquo;What do you think about it, Longinus? Cornelius and Tullia
seemed so certain he has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The centurion shook his head slowly, his eyes still on the lifting
and falling water. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think. But&rdquo;&mdash;he turned
to face her, and his forehead was furrowed in concentration&mdash;&ldquo;how
else can you explain it? The guards awake, the heavy stone
sealing the tomb. By all the gods....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long moment he was silent. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered finally,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid. But I&rsquo;m ... I&rsquo;m ashamed, Claudia; I&rsquo;m ashamed
for myself, Pilate, Herod, the contemptible High Priest, my quaternion,
everybody who had anything at all to do with this terrible
thing. If indeed he did come back to life, I hope I may see him
in Galilee and beg his forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about Pilate? Do you think the Galilean will seek
vengeance on him? And on the High Priest, and even Antipas?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_340">340</div>
<p>&ldquo;Up there on the hill as we were nailing him to the crossbeam,
that man prayed to his god to forgive us ... to forgive us,
Claudia. Didn&rsquo;t he mean <i>all</i> his enemies?&rdquo; Longinus stood up and
walked to the fountain; he held his palm against the upshooting
column. &ldquo;A few days ago I was scoffing at him and even at the
very idea of gods, any god, or spirit being, or whatever you may
call it&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled glumly&mdash;&ldquo;and so were you, my dear. But since
day before yesterday&rdquo;&mdash;he shrugged&mdash;&ldquo;and this morning, well, I&rsquo;m
... I&rsquo;m changed. You know, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what Cornelius&rsquo;
old Greek tutor taught and how it might fit in with the
Jews&rsquo; notion of their Yahweh. And now, if the Galilean really has
taken on life again&mdash;and I <i>know</i> he was <i>dead</i> when we took him
down&mdash;it may be that he really was ... is ... a physical, tangible
manifestation of this all-wise and all-powerful spirit....&rdquo;
Abruptly he broke off. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, Claudia, it&rsquo;s too deep
for me. But I do know&rdquo;&mdash;his smile was warm&mdash;&ldquo;if there&rsquo;s ever
another testing, I&rsquo;ll be on <i>his</i> side then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode over to the bench and helped her to her feet, and
they returned to her apartment where no other eyes could invade
the privacy of their last moments together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has this morning changed things for us, beloved?&rdquo; she asked,
as they sat on her couch. &ldquo;Your plans, in Rome, I mean, do you
still intend to do what you were telling me last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, my dearest. And it won&rsquo;t be long before we&rsquo;ll have
a new Emperor <i>or</i> a new Prefect. And in either case there&rsquo;ll be a
new Procurator in Judaea and&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled playfully&mdash;&ldquo;a new husband
for the present Procurator&rsquo;s wife. It&rsquo;s even possible,&rdquo; he added
with a studied air, &ldquo;that the present Procurator&rsquo;s wife will be the
wife of the new Procurator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Longinus, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to be Procurator in this
dreary province....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he broke in, &ldquo;but if the present Procurator&rsquo;s wife went
with the assignment&rdquo;&mdash;he shrugged&mdash;&ldquo;I believe I could endure it.&rdquo;
Then he was serious. &ldquo;Before the summer is ended, Claudia, I
firmly believe that Tiberius or Sejanus will be dead&mdash;and little
I care which&mdash;or both of them even, and there&rsquo;ll be a new regime
at Rome. By then, and maybe earlier, Pilate will have been banished
<span class="pb" id="Page_341">341</span>
to Gaul or Britannia or some other remote province, and
you and I will be together ... maybe living out at Baiae.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Longinus, I hope so, I do hope so.&rdquo; She clung to him
tightly, for in a few minutes, she knew, he would be leaving her
to join Cornelius for the journey down into Galilee. &ldquo;Already it
has been so long, and I am utterly weary of waiting. May the
beneficent gods grant you swift sailing and an early safe return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an arm about her waist he lifted her to her toes. &ldquo;But there
are no gods, remember?&rdquo; Teasingly, he pushed her chin until her
eager lips parted, and then hungrily he bent once again to savor
them.</p>
<h2 id="c59">59</h2>
<p>Longinus and the orderly carrying his luggage had almost reached
the foot of the Antonia stairway when a soldier came hurrying
down the steps behind them. The Procurator Pontius Pilate, the
soldier announced, wished to speak immediately with the centurion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the bags to the pack train,&rdquo; Longinus instructed his man,
&ldquo;and tell Centurion Cornelius I&rsquo;ll be there as quickly as the Procurator
dismisses me.&rdquo; Then he went at once to the Procurator&rsquo;s
chamber.</p>
<p>Pontius Pilate was standing before the window, staring in the
direction of the forlorn and frightful Hill of the Skull. When he
heard the centurion, he turned quickly and advanced toward the
center of the chamber. &ldquo;Have a seat, Centurion,&rdquo; he said, as he
pointed to a chair across the desk from his own. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll detain you
only a moment.&rdquo; His round face lighted with an unctuous
smile as he sat down heavily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon be leaving Jerusalem,
no doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_342">342</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Excellency. I was on my way, in fact, when your aide
overtook me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It occurred to me, though I haven&rsquo;t seen her since we three were
here two days ago, that Lady Claudia might like to ride with you
as far as Caesarea. She is weary of Jerusalem, I know, but I&rsquo;ll not
be able to leave here for several days. And at Caesarea you two
could enjoy one another&rsquo;s company until your ship sails for Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to Caesarea, Excellency. I&rsquo;m going to accompany
Centurion Cornelius down into Galilee, and from there
I&rsquo;ll cross to Ptolema&iuml;s and get a vessel for Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Well, then, yes.&rdquo; Pilate&rsquo;s honeyed smile vanished, and he
licked his lips. &ldquo;I thought you two would welcome an opportunity....&rdquo;
But he did not pursue the thought further. He leaned forward,
elbows on desk. &ldquo;Centurion, this &lsquo;matter of utmost concern&rsquo;
that takes you to Rome, I wonder if....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You read the Prefect&rsquo;s message,&rdquo; Longinus said, when the
Procurator paused. &ldquo;And of course, Excellency, I&rsquo;ve had no further
communication from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prefect must be calling you to Rome to discuss the situation
out here, Longinus. It would hardly be anything in Rome
that he&rsquo;s concerned about, because you wouldn&rsquo;t be familiar with
affairs there. I&rsquo;ve been trying to think what it could be that commands
his attention here.&rdquo; Pilate&rsquo;s expression was grim now, his
shallow suavity gone. &ldquo;It must be that he&rsquo;s dissatisfied with my
governing, or even&rdquo;&mdash;he swallowed, and his face was somber&mdash;&ldquo;that
he&rsquo;s planning to remove me as Procurator and extend
Herod&rsquo;s domain to include Judaea, with that incompetent weasel
as king over the entire realm his father ruled.&rdquo; He paused, his
expression questioning. &ldquo;Herodias&rsquo; scheming, I&rsquo;ll wager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, Excellency&rdquo;&mdash;Longinus shook his head&mdash;&ldquo;what the
Prefect may be planning for any of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us? By all the gods, Longinus, I hadn&rsquo;t thought that his plans
might concern you, too!&rdquo; His expression suddenly brightened.
&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s it, great Jupiter, that would solve the dilemma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Excellency, I don&rsquo;t....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg you then, Centurion, in your report to the Prefect to
deal charitably....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_343">343</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, what....?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petition him to transfer me, with comparable position and
emoluments, to some other post, Gaul, Spain, Alexandria maybe,
even Rome, and name you Procurator of Judaea, Longinus.&rdquo; The
unctuous smile, patently contrived, momentarily relieved his grimness.
&ldquo;And then, though the Prefect and the Emperor might not
permit Lady Claudia to go with me to a new post, particularly if
it should be at Rome or near the capital, I&rsquo;m sure they would permit
her to divorce me and marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the day the Galilean died&rdquo;&mdash;the discipline of long training
kept Longinus&rsquo; tone level, even though his fist ached to be
smashed against the stupidly grinning round face&mdash;&ldquo;you appeared
to be most anxious to retain your post here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mere mention of the Galilean made violence unnecessary;
the Procurator&rsquo;s mask of laughter was instantly ripped away, and
the terror beneath it now lay exposed. &ldquo;Yes, Centurion,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;but since then I ... I....&rdquo; He threw out both hands as if in
desperation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had no peace! It&rsquo;s these insufferable Jews, Centurion.
And the arrogant, demanding, conniving High Priest, may
the great Pluto grill him to cinders! I must get away from these
Jews before they drive me mad, Longinus.&rdquo; He stood up and
glanced toward the window, then shuddered and quickly turned
away. &ldquo;That Galilean, the one you crucified....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one you condemned to the cross, Excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the one <i>I</i> condemned.&rdquo; Pilate seemed suddenly very weary.
&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d purchase immunity by involving you. But I was
thinking of the High Priest on the one hand and the Prefect on
the other. I never thought of <i>him</i>. And now, now I can&rsquo;t get away
from him. I can&rsquo;t sleep, Centurion. He&rsquo;s always there between me
and sleep, his calm face confronting me, his dark eyes studying
me. It&rsquo;s as though <i>he</i> were trying <i>me</i>! I ... I can&rsquo;t get away from
him, Longinus. He&rsquo;ll haunt me as long as I remain in this abominable
province.&rdquo; He leaned on the desk with fists clenched. &ldquo;Nor
will they let him lie in his tomb and be forgotten. Have you heard
the foolish rumor&rdquo;&mdash;his eyes narrowed as he hesitated, and then
he leaned nearer the centurion&mdash;&ldquo;that the Galilean has walked
from his tomb and is on his way to Galilee?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_344">344</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Excellency, Cornelius told me the man had disappeared
under the noses of his guardsmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he told me. But of course the guards were asleep. And since
Cornelius reported the man&rsquo;s disappearance, I&rsquo;ve been told some
of the guards were bribed by Caiaphas&mdash;Pluto take him&mdash;to say
that they permitted certain of his followers to steal the body to
make it appear that he had come to life, as they claimed he
would.&rdquo; He shook his forefinger to emphasize his venom. &ldquo;That
arrogant Jew never relents in his efforts to embarrass me and undermine
my administration of Judaea&rsquo;s government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Excellency, the body <i>wasn&rsquo;t stolen</i>. Cornelius assured me
they were all wide-awake. And there was that heavy stone sealing
the mouth....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By great Jupiter, Longinus&rdquo;&mdash;Pilate sank to his chair, and his
eyes were incredulous&mdash;&ldquo;surely you don&rsquo;t believe he had supernatural
power to restore himself to life and roll back the stone?&rdquo; He
sat back; his eyes were fixed unseeing, it seemed, on the wall beyond
and above the centurion&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;He said that his kingdom
was not of this world. He said that were he to command it, a host
of his followers&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, and his eyes, intent and fearful,
sought the centurion&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;unearthly followers, Longinus, spirits,
demons....&rdquo; Quickly he leaned forward. &ldquo;Could he have been
in a trance after all? Could you have failed to take his life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was dead, Procurator; I assure you he was dead when we
put him in the tomb.&rdquo; Longinus leaned nearer his questioner.
&ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t <i>take</i> his life. When he was ready to die, he <i>surrendered</i>
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Centurion, do you realize what you&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo; A sickly smile
played at the corners of his mouth, and his usually florid face
was the shade of ashes. He braced his hands, palms down, on the
desk&rsquo;s gleaming surface. &ldquo;By great Jupiter, Longinus, do you believe
the Galilean really did return to life, that he&rsquo;s <i>alive now</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency&rdquo;&mdash;Longinus looked the Procurator straight in the
eyes&mdash;&ldquo;what other explanation could I offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate opened his mouth, but no answer came. Instead, with the
tip of his thick tongue he circled his dry lips, and a heavy sigh
stirred his ponderous frame. &ldquo;I should have had the courage to resist
<span class="pb" id="Page_345">345</span>
the High Priest and release the man,&rdquo; he observed, more to
himself than to the centurion across the desk from him. &ldquo;But I
condemned him. Then I tried to cleanse these hands&rdquo;&mdash;he turned
them over and, palms up, studied them&mdash;&ldquo;of his guiltless blood.
I <i>could</i> have freed him.&rdquo; He glanced toward the window but
quickly turned back to face Longinus. &ldquo;Centurion, do you suppose&rdquo;&mdash;perspiration
was beading on the Procurator&rsquo;s plainly
frightened face&mdash;&ldquo;he will be coming back soon from Galilee ...
to Jerusalem, the Temple, to <i>Antonia</i>? By great Jupiter, Longinus&rdquo;&mdash;he
did not pause for the centurion&rsquo;s reply&mdash;&ldquo;help me escape
him! Urge the Prefect to transfer me, send me to some post across
the world from this frightful Judaea, to Gaul, Germania, even,
by the gods, to Britannia!&rdquo; His eyes were wild, his hands on the
desk were shaking, and he clenched them into white-knuckled
fists. &ldquo;Tell him to give you Claudia; she&rsquo;s been yours anyway all
along.&rdquo; He attempted a feeble smile. &ldquo;But I ... I mustn&rsquo;t keep
you. Centurion Cornelius will be awaiting you, Longinus. Go, and
the gods give you good winds.&rdquo; His voice had calmed. &ldquo;And I beg
you, Centurion, say a good word to the Prefect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longinus nodded and quietly left the chamber. As the door
closed gently behind him, Pilate sat motionless, frozen in his
chair. But some moments later, hearing the commotion in the
courtyard below, he went to the window and watched the century,
with Cornelius and Longinus leading the column and the
pack animals at the rear, until it disappeared around the bend of
the narrow street. Then as he raised his eyes from the cobblestones
to the huddled houses beyond the Damascus Gate, a sudden sharp
glint of sunshine was reflected to them from a white-painted
titulus board nailed to a heavy timber thrusting upward from a
forlorn scarred mound on the other side of the city wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Pilate whirled about hands before his eyes as though
the flash of sunlight had blinded him. &ldquo;Flavius! Flavius!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The startled attendant rushed in. &ldquo;Yes, Excellency?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go find the commander of Antonia and tell him I want every
cross upright out there on the Hill of the Skull pulled down, and
by great Jupiter, I want it done now!&rdquo; Breathing heavily, Pilate
sat again at his desk. &ldquo;Wait. Before you go, draw those draperies.
<span class="pb" id="Page_346">346</span>
I&rsquo;m sick of the sight.&rdquo; Flavius went to the window and busied himself
with the curtains, but when he had pulled one, he discovered
that he could not draw the other all the way until the bronze stand
and wine-colored vase on it had been moved. Quickly he shifted
them to the western window a few paces away and almost directly
behind the Procurator.</p>
<p>As he did so he saw that the sun shining through the vase shot
straight outward from the delicate glass a band of red light that
crossed the floor, climbed the back of Pilate&rsquo;s chair, and went
obliquely over his shoulder to split evenly the polished surface of
the desk. Flavius turned back to the first window and pulled the
curtains together, so that not even a sliver of sunshine came
through. Then he came around in front of the Procurator. But
Pilate said nothing, and Flavius withdrew quietly, closing the door
behind him.</p>
<p>The Procurator leaned back in his chair; his arms were folded
across his middle, and his eyes appeared fixed upon a spot above
the door. But Pilate was not seeing the ornate panels; his eyes
were being held instead in the calm and untroubled gaze of another
pair of eyes....</p>
<p>Suddenly he shook his head, vigorously, as though to rid himself
of this haunting vision. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s
dead. Of course the guards dozed. Gods-come-to-earth, spirits, demons.
Woman dreaming. Jewish fanaticism. Bah! Cornelius and
Longinus wished to confuse and frighten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>... Even if he did walk from the tomb, he can cross no seas
to haunt me with pitying sad eyes. In Gaul or Germania, anywhere
but in this despicable land, I&rsquo;ll be free of him. I&rsquo;ll have escaped
him. By great Jupiter, I, afraid of a Galilean carpenter. Imagine, I,
a Roman soldier, I, by the gods, Procurator of Judaea....</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have an end to this foolishness, this child&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; he
said loudly. He sat up straight. &ldquo;The other day I washed my
hands of that man&rsquo;s death. Today, this moment, I wash them of
<i>him</i>, his circlet of thorns, his slashed back, his searching eyes, his
blood, by the gods of Rome. I&rsquo;m free of him, do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>... And I&rsquo;m not afraid to look through that window at his hill
of death....</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_347">347</div>
<p>&ldquo;Flavius!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Come draw aside the draperies. I want
to see outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted his hands to the desk and, leaning forward, began to
rise.</p>
<p><i>... By great Jupiter, I&rsquo;ll go look out the window now. I&rsquo;ve
purged myself of the Galilean; I&rsquo;ve washed my hands of that
man....</i></p>
<p>He glanced downward.</p>
<p>Flavius, entering the chamber in response to Pilate&rsquo;s summons,
halted abruptly. Procurator Pontius Pilate, ruler of Judaea, his eyes
wide with terror, stood rigid in his tracks, staring at his hands.</p>
<p>From wrists to fingertips, in the fiery beam from the window,
they flamed a gory crimson.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
